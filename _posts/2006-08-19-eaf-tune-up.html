<p>I just finished tuning the electric arc furnace (EAF) at one of our Jersey facilities. It seems to be running better. I just need to do some analysis on the data, and maybe make a few small adjustments later on. But, now they want me to work on the burners also. I will have to come back and do that later. My schedule for the rest of this month is crazy.</p>
