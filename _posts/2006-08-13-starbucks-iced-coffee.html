<p>I have tried to make Starbucks iced coffee at home several times, and it never turned out so well. But, this weekend I figured out how to do it, and it was just about perfect.</p>
<p>You have to buy the Starbucks Espresso Roast beans and grind them up. Make the coffee with these grounds in a French coffee press. Put the coffee in the freezer for a few hours to cool it down. If you try to pour it in hot, it will melt all of the ice, and dillute the coffee to an unacceptable level. After the coffee is cooled down, pour it over some ice in a glass, and you are set. Enjoy.</p>
