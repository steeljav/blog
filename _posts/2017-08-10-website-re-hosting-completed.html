<p>I completed moving this website from self-hosted Wordpress to wordpress.com. It really couldn't have went smoother and I'm really happy with the decision. My e-mail transition on the other hand .... not so smooth and all my fault. My main e-mail is my first name at this domain and was hosted by the same place as my wordpress and so I needed to move it. I have all of my domains registered at <a href="http://hover.com">hover</a>Â and they have been great so I decided to use them for email also. I screwed up the mail forwarding DNS configuration here at wordpress.com which screwed my e-mail up for most of 8/8 until I realized the issue. If I missed an e-mail from you I apologize.</p>
