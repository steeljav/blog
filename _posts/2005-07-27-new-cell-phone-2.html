<p>I finally got a new cell phone last week. I have been here for 2 years now, and still had my old cell with a twin cities number. I went ahead and changed the number so that it is local for people here to call me. </p>
<p>I wanted to let the battery die completely this week and it finally did today. Unfortunately I am at work and don't have a charger for it here. So, this got me thinking about how nice it would be if the phone had a usb port and it could charge over the usb bus like my iRiver does. The next logical step in this progression would be for the phone to actually act like a usb storage device. Then it would be possible to download/upload pictures and any other data between the PC. I could see that being very handy. I guess the only problem with this would be that the phone company wouldn't make their $0.25 per picture transfer, or whatever they charge, I haven't transferred any yet.</p>
<p>You would think that the phone manufacturers would build phones like this, I can't be the only person that wants something like this. I guess they are probably concerned that the providers wouldn't buy the phones. I was just thinking that it would nice to have a phone that doesn't suck.</p>
