<p>I really suck at blogging. I keep saying that I am going to make more of an effort to keep up with this, but then other obligations take priority and I am not able to do it.</p>
<p>Professionally 2008 was an exceptional year. I made a phenomenal amount of $$$ for my company. The exact amount depends on market conditions, price of consumables, etc. Using some fairly conservative numbers, I calculate that the rate of return on my salary is approximately 30,000 percent. <b>Please show me where I can put my money to get this level of return!</b></p>
<p>I travelled a lot last year. Probably too much, certainly more than I wanted to. The biggest problem with travelling so much is that I end up working 16+ hour days all the time. Things need to change this year. I have been home the last few weeks and it has been really nice. I have been able to make some progress on my 1918 bungalow.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that 2009 will be a challenging year. I have some difficult decisions to make in 2009.</p>
