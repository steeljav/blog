<p>I just realized that I haven't posted anything to the blog in several days now. I started school again on Monday. I am trying to complete an MSEE. I'm not sure why sometimes. I don't think that it will do anything for me at my current employer. For a while I thought that I may get a shot at being an engineering manager after I completed the MSEE, but since they have hired this new guy from the outside and relieved my manager of his duties, I just don't see it happening. So, basically I am stuck in my position. Probably for many years to come. I believe that Gerdau has some sort of transfer program, but I do not see them being organized enough to actually know who they have where, what their skills are and what their needs are. This tells me that to move up I will need to move on. I am ok with that. I should be working on starting a business instead of finding a new job. I don't like having a boss, never have. Probably because I have only had 1 or 2 decent ones.</p>
<p>So I am taking DSP and Pattern Recognition this semester. Should be decent classes. But, I am going to be very, very busy for the next 4 months.</p>
