<a href="http://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php" target="_blank">Passport Index</a> is a site that ranks passports of the world based on the concept of a visa free score:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Visa Free Score</strong><br />
Passports accumulate points for each visa free country that their holders can visit without a visa, or they can obtain a visa on arrival.</p></blockquote>
<p>Surprised to see the US and UK are tied for #1. I travel and sometimes it doesn't feel this way (thinking of you Canada).</p>
