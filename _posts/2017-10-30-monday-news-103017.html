<p>Sounds like <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-41799255" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the shit is really hitting the fan</a> for Kobe steel over their quality falsification. The thing that's interesting to me is that Kobe has the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">integrity</span> to admit guilt and deal with the issue. Makes you wonder how much cheap steel illegally imported from you know where actually meets its standards? Kobe's stock is down ~ 30%.</p>
<p><a href="http://ft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT</a> has an(other) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/992ad270-b4d3-11e7-aa26-bb002965bce8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article about global over-capacity</a> that touches on the status of capacity cuts in China. Germany is hosting <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-steel-meeting/steel-producing-nations-to-discuss-overcapacity-in-berlin-in-november-idUSKBN1CB0NW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a meeting</a> in Berlin in November to discuss global overcapacity (I didn't get invited).</p>
<p>Ore is <a href="http://www.mining.com/china-imported-record-iron-ore-september-steel-output-curbs-start-bite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegedly piling up</a> in China due to a record import month and capacity cuts. Futures prices of ore in China are down as a result. There is some <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-steel-capacity-global/global-steel-recovery-at-risk-from-capacity-ramp-ups-outside-china-idUSKBN1CF1UU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concern</a> that new capacity in the Middle East and Asia will be dumped onto the global market and offset any capacity cuts made in China.</p>
<p>The Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa is concerned about US investigation into wire rod from Italy, the Republic of Korea, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine and/or the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/sa-steel-industry-concerned-about-us-probe-into-carbon-and-wire-rod-imports-11772921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a>.</p>
