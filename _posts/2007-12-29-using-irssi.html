<p>I started using <a href="http://irssi.org">irssi</a> for IRC a few weeks ago. It is really a nice client, and if you know perl, you can do a lot with it through scripts. The biggest problem that I had with irssi was getting it to auto-connect and auto-identify to servers and then auto-join channels. I was trying to set this stuff up through irssi's startup file, but was not able to get it to work.</p>
<p>To get irssi to auto-connect and auto-identify with the servers I used </p>
<p class="quote">&amp;nbsp /server add -auto -network freenode irc.freenode.net 6667 password</p>
<p>and then to get the channels I used </p>
<p class="quote">&amp;nbsp /channel add -auto #ruby-lang freenode</p>
<p>I set everything up manually inside of irssi and then just used the /save command which writes everything out to the ~/.irssi/config file. When I restarted irssi, everything did what I wanted it to do.</p>
