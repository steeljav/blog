<p>Quite a while ago I registered for a <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/home">google analytics account</a>. I received a number to use this service a few months ago, and just got around to putting this into the weblog. So far, I don't think that this provides anything more than <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">awstats</a> with the exception of the geo-map, which is pretty cool. But, all you have to do to set it up is paste some javascript code into the page, whereas with awstats, you have to do some configuration of apache and the application, which isn't too big of a deal, unless you don't have control of the server.</p>
<p>When I get some more hits on the blog, I will post some shots of what google analytics provides.</p>
