<p>I think that I am going to buy one of <a href="http://www.plugcomputer.org">these</a>. I would really like to run <a href="http://www.samba.org">Samba</a> and my <a href="http://www.mysqueezebox.com/download">SqueezeCenter</a> servers on this. I am confident it can handle the Samba, but I'm not so sure about the squeezecenter stuff, it is written in perl and probably a little bloated. Runnig a caching nameserver and <a href="http://www.privoxy.org">privoxy</a> on it would probably be pretty cool also.</p>
