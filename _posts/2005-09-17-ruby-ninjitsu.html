<p>I am still working on my Perl script for my pattern recognition class. There was a time a few years ago when I swore by Perl. Since learning Ruby though, I really feel like Perl is clunky. This is what really drove it home in Ruby I can do something like,</p>
<p>str = "1.2 3.4 3.4 1 2 3 classx"<br />
class = str.split(' ')[-1]</p>
<p>In Perl I have to do,</p>
<p>my $str = "1.2 3.4 3.4 1 2 3 classx";<br />
my @tmp = split(' ', $str);<br />
my $class = $tmp[-1];</p>
<p>One extra line, big deal right? But look at how much cleaner the Ruby code looks. Now, extend that purity throughout a few hundred or thousand lines. It truly is amazing at how clean and sweet and powerful Ruby is.</p>
