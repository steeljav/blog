This is hard to believe. I really thought that they would have been returned by now. The best place to keep up on developments is probably the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">BBC</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I have heard about enough of Ahmadinejad's BS and would like nothing more than to see the Britt's go in and get their people back. Officially we (USA) have been asked not to get involved, but hopefully our people are involved with any rescue attempt. We certainly have enough troops in the area.</p>
