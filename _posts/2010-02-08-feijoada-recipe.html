<p>Feijoada is Brazil's national dish, and one of my favorites. I haven't had it in quite a while and was looking around for a recipe. The last time I made it at home it didn't turn out so well. There is a good looking recipe for it <a href="http://www.sonia-portuguese.com/recipes/feijoada.htm">here</a> in both Portuguese and English. Some of the ingredients may be difficult to find depending on where you are at.</p>
