<p>I recently watched a multi-part series on VH1 Classics about the history of metal. They had a cool interview with a couple of the guys from <a href="http://www.mastodonrocks.com">Mastodon</a>. Mastodon is a metal band who I have heard of but never listened to. They were talking about reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick">Moby Dick</a> and recording a concept CD that is loosely based on the novel. I'm always looking for new music and so thought I would roll the dice and check it out. I have listened to it many times over now and can say that it totally rocks. If you are into heavier music then I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>I remember reading a summary version of Moby Dick when I was in High School. Listening to Leviathan got me interested in the book again and so I picked up a copy of the full version and will start reading it this weekend and am really looking forward to it.</body></html></p>
