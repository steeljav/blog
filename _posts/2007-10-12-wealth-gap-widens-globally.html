<p>I trimmed an article from the WSJ last weekend. From the article: </p>
<p class="quote">New data show the number of millionaire household in the world soared 14% last year, and that those households control at least a third of the world's wealth.</p>
<p>I am wondering if the data includes the primary residence as an asset. That would explain the increase considering that housing prices have increased globally. </p>
<p class="quote">Households with 1 million or more in assets represented 0.7% of the word's total and were sitting on $33.2 Trillion, or about a third of the world's total. Households with less than $100,000 saw a slight decline in their assets, from $13.5 to $13.4 trillion.</p>
