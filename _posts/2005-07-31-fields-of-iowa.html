<p>Went to a party at this friends house last night. Man, he really lives out in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=wyoming+iowa&amp;ll=42.043684,-91.028595&amp;spn=0.266921,0.431831&amp;hl=en">middle of nowhere Iowa</a>. He owns 8 acres and a nice bungalow North of Wyoming Iowa. He has a nice view. The area is actually rolling hills as opposed to the typical flatness of most of Iowa.</p>
<p>It is really a nice place, and if it were not for the inevitable lack of a decent internet connection I think I would like to be somewhere similar. It was really quiet and peaceful. Not only that, but you have privacy and you have a lot of freedom to do what you want. He plays drums in a band, so for the party he had his band come out and set up and they played outside. The yard was big enough for  a whole lot of people to come and not be crowded. Pretty cool.</p>
<p>Land in Iowa is really affordable compared to a lot of the rest of the US. Farm land here sells for around $3000 per acre. I have been told that farm land in Nebraska is around $200 per acre. But, if you have ever driven through Nebraska, that is understandable. You can buy a .5 acre lot on a golf course here for around $40K, which I think is reasonable considering household incomes in the area.</p>
