<p>I pay for 1TB of google drive storage. I love google drive but it has one big problem that I expected to be solved by now: there is no official support for Linux. I use Linux and Samba for a file server and would like to back everything up automatically. There is no way to do that without a google client for Linux. There are several 3rd party options available, but I'm hesitant to use them.</p>
<p>I'm considering a move to dropbox or even icloud. I just don't want to do it because google drive works so well for everything I need.</p>
