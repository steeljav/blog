<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_duet.html">Logitech Squeezebox Duet</a>. I have wanted to get one of these for a few years. I finally have something to connect it to, so I decided it was time. The squeezebox allows you to stream your encoded music, podcasts or internet radio to your stereo.</p>
<p>Set-up was a little rough around the edges. The sequence of menus that come up on the remote do not match what is in the documentation. If you want to have the remote and receiver both connect to your network via wireless, then you will not have any problems at all. I wanted the remote to connect via wireless, but the receiver to use a wired connection. I wasn't able to set it up the way I wanted.</p>
<p>Other than the setup issues, the system works great and I am very happy with it. I am finally able to listen to <a href="http://www.wbez.org/default.aspx">Chicago Public Radio</a> on my stereo again.</p>
