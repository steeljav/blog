<p>January's <a href="http://www.muscleandfitness.com/">Muscle and Fitness</a> contains a lot of beginner's information for all of the people making new years resolutions. Some interesting statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>67% of people with gym memberships never use them.</li>
<li>10% of resolutions are to exercise more.</li>
<li>15% of Americans belong to a gym.</li>
<li>19% of resolutions are to lose weight.</li>
<li>67% of Americans make 3 resolutions every year.</li>
<li>80% of people who join a gym in January quit by February.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I like <a href="http://www.muscleandfitness.com/">Muscle and Fitness</a> for the nutrition information that it always has. This month's issue has one of the best articles on eating to build muscle that I have read (starting on pg. 92). Nothing really surprising here, but all of the important basics in one place for a beginner. Definitely worth the cover price. </p>
