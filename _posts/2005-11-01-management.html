<p>I am starting to see that my new boss is basically the same as the old boss when it comes to software projects. Pretty much clueless. Sounds like the new boss did a software project once or something, so of course if you ask him, he is an expert. These guys do not understand schedule estimation in software. It is a huge problem that seems to plague software companies little and big, and it deffinitiely is a problem for managers on the customer side. What they don't seem to understand is that there is a world of difference between an 'estimate' and a 'goal'. The project that I am working on was given a 'goal', against my wishes. The problem with 'goals' is that they don't take into consideration the resources you have available to you.</p>
<p>If a manager asks me for an 'estimate', then knowing the productivity of the developers, and the size of the project I will do the best I can to provide a schedule that is as accurate as possible with respect to how the group will perform. If I give that estimate back to the manager, and the manager cuts it in half and gives it back to me and tells me to start, we have just been given a 'goal'. 'Goals' are rarely met.</p>
<p>If you want to validate software schedule estimates, I would suggest reading one of Tom Demarco's books, and pick up a copy of Capers Jones's book. Capers has tables which detail average productivity for different types of languages and domains.</p>
<p>The new boss came to me yesterday to discuss the project being behind. I explained that the schedule estimates that were accepted by corporate managers above me were BS. The new boss claims that it doesn't matter. I think what he meant to say was that it doesn't matter to him, because it certainly does matter to me.</p>
<p>What am I trying to say here? I guess that for a while I was thinking that I had the managers that I work for educated about 'goals', 'estimates' and software projects. I am seeing now that they either were not listening, or don't care.</p>
