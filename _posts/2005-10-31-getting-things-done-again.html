<p>I had another thing that I thought I should say about "Getting Things Done." There are only 24 hours in a day. No process is going to get you around that obstacle. </p>
<p>A problem that I have at work is that I simply have more piled on me than I can realistically handle. Where I work, everyone seems to have that problem. We are short handed, and I don't think that will change. I think that I do a pretty good job at dealing with the important stuff, and putting the not so important stuff away until I can deal with it. Especially given the resources that I have at my disposal (not much). </p>
<p>Keep in mind that there are no silver bullets when it comes to processes. David Allen's process is pretty good, but there are still only 24 hours in a day.</p>
