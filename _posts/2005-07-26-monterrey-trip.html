<p>I had to move the trip to Mexico back until the 7th. But, I will be down there for a week, from the 7th until the 14th, so there is a very good chance that we will be going to a soccer game. Probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayados">Rayados (stripes)</a>, they are actually just called Monterrey. There are 2 soccer teams in Monterrey. The other team is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UANL_Tigres">Tigres</a>. The Tigres are the larger and probably more popular team. The Tigres are in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Libertadores_de_Am%C3%A9rica">Copa Libertadores</a> tournament this year.</p>
<p>I will be working quite a bit while I am down there, but I am looking forward to it. Myself and the lead developer for the company that we are working with need to go through the system as much as possible. We have a lot in common, both geeks, both like coding and doing a good job etc. etc. So, we will be working our asses off, eating tortas and tacos and drinking large amounts of caffeinated beverages, with few distractions. Should be a good time.</p>
