<p>I was checking out the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/pop/blogs/"> Technorati top 100 blogs</a> today. If you are unfamiliar with what technorati is, it is a blog scouring/spidering thingy that has a search utility and generally returns only the newest posts. So I was looking at some of these top 100 blogs and wondering how in the hell they came up with this top 100 list. Some of these blogs have around 2 posts per day. I would think that a blog in top 100 would have much more activity than that.</p>
<p>Whatever, what do I know?</p>
