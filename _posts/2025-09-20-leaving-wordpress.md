I haven't blogged much lately due to time constraints. I have been paying for Wordpress for several years now
and felt like it was worth it because it makes it so easy to post from mobile, add pictures, etc.

I've been moving sites around and trying to get more organized and wanted to put some time into the Wordpres site.
All I wanted to do was update my theme to something very simple and clean, mostly text. Converted to the 2025 theme
and it was an absolute mess. I've customized themes in the past and so wasn't too worried about it. Started working
on the theme and it was a frustrating experience. It shouldn't be so hard to make simple changes to your blog.

So I'm leaving Wordpress. I found Jekyll an learned that it was trivial to host it using github pages and so exported
(liberated?) the blog from Wordpress. The Wordpress export format has too many fields in the yaml frontmatter for
Jekyll and so had to write some python to clean the posts up so they would render correctly. No big deal.

I noticed some of the old posts were missing pictures and will work on trying to find and fix them.

Still learning Jekyll, but so far it's exactly what I wanted: clean and simple with revision control and posts
authored in markdown.
