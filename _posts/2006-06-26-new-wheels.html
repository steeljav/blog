<p>After driving my trusty red 97 cavalier for the last 5 years, I finally got some new wheels. I bought a 99 Land Rover Discovery II. It is black, has all of the options that were offered on that model, has about 74K miles and runs pretty good.</p>
<p>I will get some pictures later and post them. This is a second vehicle for us. It is my work car. But, I also expect it to be a recreational vehicle to do some camping and light off-roading. </p>
<p>So far, my first impressions are pretty good. A lot of reviewers complain about the layout of the buttons and controls. They are different, that is for sure. But I think it just takes a little getting used to.</p>
<p>I have a few things to fix on it. There appears to be a small oil leak on the passenger side valve cover gasket. The gasket is rubber, and costs a few bucks. It will need brakes sometime soon. I want to change all of the fluids because I am not sure about the maintenance history on it. Minor stuff mostly.</p>
