<p>I am pretty excited about the 2007 season of baseball. Things will be getting under way here in just about another week and a half. My beloved Chicago Cubs have a new coach, and hopefully a chance at doing something this year. Hopefully Dusty Baker didn't screw things up so bad that it will take a few years to fix.</p>
<p>I have said this before, but I hope to go catch at least a couple games this season. I am thinking about going to see the Royals, and also the White Sox. I also would like to go see the four A league teams that are around us: Quad Cities Swing, Burlington Bees, Clinton Lumber Kings, and the Cedar Rapids Kernels.</p>
<p>This year I purchased the Bill James Handbook and the BP Baseball Prospectus. If you need a good source of statistics, these are both excellent.</p>
