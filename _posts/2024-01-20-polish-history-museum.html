<p>I had the privilege of visiting Warsaw in November. I went to the Polish Army museum (awesome) which is located just to the right of where this picture was taken.</p>

<p>The History Museum was open but appeared to still be in development. I didn't have time to go through it on this trip. I'll be back and will visit it next time.</p>

<p>It's an incredibly cool looking building and the gray (cold and rainy) day really complimented it in this picture.</p>
