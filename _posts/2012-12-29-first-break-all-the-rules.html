<p>I was required to read 4 management books for work this year (see previous post). The second book that I read was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently/dp/0684852861/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356820913&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=first+break+all+the+rules">First Break All The Rules</a>. This was a decent book that tries to answer the question "what do great managers do differently". I don't have the time to write a thorough review of the book, many others already have. A couple of items that I noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the minds of great managers, every role performed at excellence deserves respect.</li>
<li>Most employees are promoted to their level of incompetence. It's inevitable. It's built into the system.</li>
<li>In most cases, no matter what it is, if you measure it and reward it, people will try to excel at it.</li>
<li>If you can't spend four hours a year with each of your people, then you've either got too many people, or you shouldn't be a manager.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The book is a little dry and slow in places, but overall is a good read with some excellent tips and insights. I can recommend it.</body></html></p>
