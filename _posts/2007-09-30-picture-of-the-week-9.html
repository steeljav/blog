We stayed at the Embassy Suites in the River North area. It was a very convenient hotel to stay at. The <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/">CTA</a> was right across the street, day passes cost $5. By using the L trains and the busses, It is very easy to get around inside of the city using the CTA. I am not sure how well it works if you are out in the suburbs though.</p>
<p>We spent quite a bit of time messing around at <a href="http://www.navypier.com/home.html"> Navy Pier</a>. This picture was taken from the pier looking West at the River North area of Chicago. I could really handle living in this part of Chicago. If you are visiting Chicago, I highly recommend that you stay in the River North area.</p>
<p>Sorry about the lack of updates on the picture of the week. I have been either very busy, or traveling.</p>
