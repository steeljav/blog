<p>When I was stationed in Germany I went to Paris several times. I have actually made it all the way through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_du_Louvre">Musee du Louvre</a>. It took several trips. One of my favorite paintings there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_of_the_Medusa">The Raft of the Medusa</a>. It is absolutely enormous and the way the colors stand out in it are really nice. I'm not sure what made me think about this, but if you go to the Louvre be sure to check it out.</p>
