<p>Went on vacation last Thursday after returning from Knoxville. We drove down to Atlanta for a few days, then drove over to Vicksburg Mississippi, got on Highway 61 and drove North to Rosedale and went camping. I have some more to say about it, and I will put some pictures on here once I get the van unloaded, mow the yard, and catch up on everything else.</p>
