<p>I was worried about getting through security on Friday, so we went over to the airport in Tampa pretty early. It took all of about 5 minutes to get through. No problems at all. I think that the delays were really overblown by the media. Maybe in some of the bigger shitty airports like Atlanta, Chicago, LAX and New York it was an issue, but I haven't heard of anyone else having problems either.</p>
