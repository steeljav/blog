<p>I've been working from home (and traveling) for the last 3 years. Any employer with positions that can be modified to remote work would be smart to do so, even if it is only part time remote work. My productivity has increased by at least 20% just from reduced interruptions alone. Factor in the time saved from not commuting (which I spend working instead), the additional hours put in (because I'm home and it's easy to put in more hours) and the cost savings (from not supplying office space) and it really is a no brainer.</p>
