<p>I was able to import all (I think) of my blog posts from my previous blogs using some ruby scripting and the WordPress RSS import tool. Most of the links will work, but some will be broken. Most of the posts will look fine but some are off due to issues with css. I don't have the expertise with WordPress yet to make the posts relying on an external stylesheet work with the default stylesheet.</p>
<p>Contact me if you find a broken link to something you are interested in. I can probably dig it out of the archive.</p>
