Some of the old posts from wordpress (and others) had a cover photo (featured image) 
that showed up in the post listing. This seems like the natural way to show a post listing in a blog to me.

The default jekyll theme that I am using (minima) does not have this feature. I tried using my friend
github copilot to assist with adding the templates to make this happen and it didn't go well. Apparently
customization of themes in Jekyll isn't the easiest thing to do. I suspect it's not that big of a deal
but if you read the docs and handle most of it yourself. But if you attempt to let AI handle everything
it won't be correct. That is consistent with my AI experience.
