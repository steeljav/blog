<p>I was just getting to sleep last night a few minutes after midnight. I heard something that sounded like one of the kids fell out of bed, loud enough that it scared me. Went in to the kids's rooms and they were both in bed sound asleep. After looking around and waking up and trying to figure out what happened, we finally figured out that the ice jam at the bottom of the gutter next to the bedroom broke loose and fell onto the roof over the kitchen. It was a big chunk of ice that must have weighed around 50 Lbs or so. It sounded just like one of the kids falling out of bed, weird.</p>
