<p>Back in September 2006, I mentioned something about randomly choosing a stock fund to see how it would do. Well, I chose one and just checked on the results, basically one year later. I chose the stocks by randomly choosing a number 1-3, and then randomly choosing that number of letters. If there was no stock with that symbol, then the process was repeated. I chose the following 10 stocks: AV, PAE, LG, GEX, O, Q, GS, X, BA, E and noted the purchase price on that date.</p>
<p>So after about one year, my randomly chosen fund has increased in value by <u><b>53.59%!</b></u> Hard to believe. Now, if I could just have that kind of luck for real.</p>
