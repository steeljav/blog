<p>I usually just use <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb">yahoo's mlb site</a> to check out what is happening in baseball. I was going through some bookmarks and decided to check out the cubs site since I haven't been there in a long time. I remember why I don't go to MLB's official team sites. They suck. The cubs official site is so noisy that it is starting to resemble the icq's crazy site around 1997 or so. I remember going to icq's site trying to figure out where to download from. It was painful. Around that time Google came along and its simplicity was a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>If anyone from the cubs organization is listening: "FIX YOUR BROKEN WEBSITE. IT SUCKS." If anyone from MLB is listening: "MAKE YOUR GAMEDAY REALAUDIO STREAMS WORK ON LINUX."</p>
