<p>This is a <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/08/26/weekinreview/27leon_graph2.large.gif">link</a> to an inflation adjusted chart of home values from 1890 until the present. Note the run-up starting around 97. Interesting.</p>
<p>As I have said before, I don't think that the current prices in some areas are sustainable. Things might get ugly in the next few years. A good time to be a buyer.</p>
