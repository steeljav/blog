<p>Over the last year or so I have lost around 40 pounds. I did not research dieting and I did not spend any money on books or diet food or anything else. My approach worked rapidly and takes less than one sheet of paper to describe.</p>
<h3><u>The Bottom Line</u></h3>
<p>Losing weight comes down to simple math: <u>You Have To Burn More Calories Than You Take In.</u></p>
<h3><u>Diet</u></h3>
<p>I started by paying more attention to what I ate and drank. I stopped drinking pop altogether which eliminated several hundred calories per day. For breakfast I started having one piece of fruit and a cup of tea with one teaspoon of sugar and a splash of milk. For lunch I have two pieces/servings of fruit or vegetables. For supper I have a <u>normal</u> supper. By normal I mean one normal sized plate of food. For example: if we make tacos I have two tacos with one cup of rice. Other than this I might have a beer or two. You can and should drink all of the water you want and/or need. I typically have one day per week where I splurge a little, especially on Sundays during football season.</p>
<h3><u>Exercise</u></h3>
<p>I started jogging and I believe this is what caused the rapid weight loss that I achieved. I realize that many people are not able to jog and I recommend that those people try to walk or swim laps. I started by jogging for as long as I could (around 5 minutes), then walking for a few minutes, then jogging again then walking for a total of around 20 minutes. Eventually I got to a point where I could jog for 20 minutes continuously. After I achieved 20 minutes I started going for distance and longer times.</p>
<p>I never worried about my pace (and still don't). I focused on achieving 70-80% of my target heart rate and maintaining it for as long as possible. I had a goal of participating in the Chicago half marathon but wasn't able to do it due to travel for work. The longest that I ran for was about 1 hour and 40 minutes. If you choose to jog, be sure to get a good pair of running shoes. If you feel any discomfort when jogging, especially in the knees or hips, stop and go for a walk instead. Forget the no pain no gain mentallity, it isn't worth causing damage to your body.</p>
<p>I jogged in the morning in the beginning because I read someplace that it increases your metabolism for the entire day. Unfortunately I am only able to jog at night now. I prefer to jog in the morning, it makes me more alert throughout the day and I get it out of the way early.</p>
<p>Be sure to have some type of warmup activity prior to jogging. I walk for about 20 minutes. Also be sure to stretch when you are finished jogging, it will reduce the amount of soreness.</p>
<p>Jogging has provided several other benefits besides weight loss for me. It really seems to curb my hunger and eventually I felt like I had more energy.</p>
<p>That is basically it. No secret/fad diet, no special foods, nothing complicated. I did get hungry, especially in the beginning and still do sometimes. I found that chewing on gum and drinking water helps.</p>
