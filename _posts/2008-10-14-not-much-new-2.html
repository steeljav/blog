<p>Not too much new with me. Sorry I haven't posted sooner. I have been meaning to but have been busy with work, travel, kids, home, etc. What's new with me: </p>
<ul>
<li>Will be installing 200A service in the house soon and will begin rewiring immediately.</li>
<li>Going to put 4000W of electric baseboard heat on the porch so that we can use it this winter. It is currently not heated and will be a nice place to sit in the winter because it is very bright.</li>
<li>Steel business is slowing down so I will not be traveling so much in the near term.</li>
<li>Bought a dog for the kids. Decided to get an English Mastif. She is 5 months old, and is one of the best puppies I have ever had. She is going to be big.</li>
<li>Made a quick trip down to Brazil last week for 4 days. It was nice as always.</li>
<li>Still studying Portuguese. I am getting to the point where I can get the gist of a conversation, especially if I have some of the context. However, I still can not understand people from the North of Brazil very well.</li>
</ul>
