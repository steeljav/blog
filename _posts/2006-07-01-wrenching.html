<p>I wrenched on the Land Rover a little bit today. I have been wanting to wrench on it for a while. </p>
<p>I wanted to get the oil changed, because it looked to me like whoever did it last didn't change the filter. They put the oil plug back in with an impact wrench. I had to run to the parts store to pick up a 15mm 1/2" drive socket and some extensions to be able to break it loose. The problem with changing oil in the land rover is that it sets up so high that when the oil drains, it splatters all over the place. I also burned my arm on the exhaust.</p>
<p>I was hoping to wash and wax it, and get the plugs changed today, but it started raining, and the engine was still hot, so I called it quits. I will tear into it tomorrow.</p>
