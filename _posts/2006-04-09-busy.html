<p>I have been too busy for too long now. This is the last weekend that I have to write my Masters Thesis, which is what I am working on right now. I need to get it turned in to my thesis committee this week so that they have about 2 weeks to review it. Once this is out of the way, I need to generate a presentation and prepare for the thesis defense which is on the 24th. I will be glad to get it out of the way. Then, the only thing left is to finish up my numerical optimization course and graduate. Then, hopefully I can start posting more things to this blog.</p>
