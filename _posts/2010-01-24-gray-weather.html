<p>I really need to go for a jog. I haven't been able to go for quite a while because of snow and ice, and very cold weather (winter made an appearance in Iowa again). The last couple of weeks have been miserable and gray. It warmed up this weekend but rained most of the time. It is supposed to start snowing tonight.</p>
<p>I am about ready to break down and go to the YMCA and jog on the indoor track. I hate running indoors.</p>
