<p>I have multiple blog posts about my long history of maintaining organized, coherent notes at work, for research, development, etc. I was using <a href="https://www.vim.org">vim</a> and html before OneNote, Apple Notes, Evernote, etc.</p>

<p>I have tried multiple note apps in search of the best fit for me. I got interested in <a href="https://logseq.com">logseq</a> last year and started using it for small things to wrap my head around how it works. It's not the simplest note taking app but is extremely powerful. I'm using maybe 20% of the features and wish I could have had it years ago. It has simplified the organization of information more than I could have imagined.</p>

<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=logseq">YouTube videos on logseq</a>. Some are really good, but others are a little esoteric and over-complicate it more than it needs to be.</p>

<p>If you have issues with organization of digital notes and recall, give logseq a try. When used properly, those issues are completely eliminated.</p>
