<p>Me: my flight is delayed, I'm going to miss my connection, I'm going to get off in Chicago and just want to check my bag to O'Hare</p>
<p>American: why do you want to do that?</p>
<p>Me: because I'm going to miss my connection and I want my bag</p>
<p>American: why don't you just continue on to your final destination?</p>
<p>Me: I'm going to miss my connection, it's the last flight.</p>
<p>American: why don't you just wait and take the next flight?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I swear this went on for 5 minutes. I know they have done this before, but now claim they can't. Someday I won't have to fly on US airlines anymore.</p>
