<p>I really don't have many pet peaves. Being like most midwest people, I don't get excited about much. But one thing that really bothers me is when I e-mail someone, and I never hear back from them. I understand that e-mail is not a very good means of communication and I still use the phone, especially if I need to get something important taken care of. But, you would think that everyone could at least take 5 seconds to hit the reply button and type ok or no or yes or get back to you later or something.</p>
