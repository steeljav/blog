<p>CNNMoney has a nice article <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/09/01/8384325/">here</a> about blogging for cash. Looks like a few people are doing very well. Not much of a surprise that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">BoingBoing</a> is going to make over a million this year. Some of the others that they mention in the article are a little surprising. I haven't heard of most of them.</p>
