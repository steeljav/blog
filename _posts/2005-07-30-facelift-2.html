<p>I started playing around with the styles-site.css file to make the blog look a little different. Not sure what kind of look I am going for. I guess I want something terminalish/unixy looking. Green on black, monospace font, things like that for now. </p>
<p>I edited the file directly, so hopefully my changes are still there after I save this post.</p>
