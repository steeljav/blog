<p>I started becoming interested in eating food that is grown relatively local the last time I heard about tainted apple juice from China. It was really shocking to me that the USA would import apple juice of all things from China.</p>
<p>We actually do pretty well in terms of eating locally. We buy half of a cow from a local farmer about twice a year. My father in law is retired and spends most of his spring/summer free time gardening. His garden is a poster child for miracle grow, and we are able to can a lot of tomatoes, peppers, beans, etc. Even though we do pretty well in terms of eating locally I think we could do better, especially in terms of breads, fruits and dairy products.</p>
<p>I was googling around and found some interesting links regarding eating locally. <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> had a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5709576"> piece on this</a> in August 2006. <a href="http://www.localharvest.org"> LocalHarvest</a> is a website to help locate farmers and farmers markets. <a href="http://100milediet.org/home/">These guys</a> developed a 100 mile diet in Vancouver. They ate food grown within 100 miles of them for a year, and wrote a book about it. NPR covered it <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10219029">here</a>.</p>
