<p>Here are some notes that I made from the August issue of Money Magazine.</p>
<p>Scottsdale Az. was chosen as #7 in the annual best places to live survey. The 'typical' single family home in Scottsdale comes in at $500,000. They did not mention what the 'typical' household income is in Scottsdale. My guess would be ~$70-$80K/Yr. Can someone please explain to me how this is a great place to live when the 'typical' home price to household income ratio is around 6.25? Don't get me wrong, I lived in Phoenix for a year and I like Scottsdale, it is very nice. But I think that the only people that can afford to be there are: </p>
<ol>
<li>People cashing out of LA/SF/SD and moving there.</li>
<li>People that lived there 10 years ago.</li>
<li>Dr. married to Lawyer households.</li>
<li>Seriously overextended people buying on 5/1 or 3/1 ARMS.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eden Prairie Mn. made the list at #10. I like Eden Prairie, I lived in Mn. for 2 years. But ... the traffic is very, very bad in the SouthWest metro area. If you are able to live 2 blocks from work, or telecommute, then maybe it would be ok. But if you have to commute to another suburb to work, it is going to get old.</p>
<p>Money conducted a poll of 1000 people and asked two open ended questions, here are the results:</p>
<p>If you were moving, what would be the most important characteristic your new town should have? </p>
<ul>
<li>14% - Job Opportunities</li>
<li>11% - Good Schools</li>
<li>9% - Low Crime Rate</li>
<li>8% - Good Arts and Leisure Scene</li>
<li>6% - Nice Weather</li>
<li>5% - Quality Health Care</li>
<li>5% - Lack of Congestion</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you dislike most about your current hometown? </p>
<ul>
<li>16% - Too Much Congestion</li>
<li>9% - High Crime Rate</li>
<li>7% - Lack of Job Opportunities</li>
<li>7% - Poor Arts and Leisure Scene</li>
<li>5% - High Taxes/Cost of Living</li>
<li>4% - People Here Aren't Like Me</li>
<li>4% - Poor Munincipal Services</li>
</ul>
