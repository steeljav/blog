<p>We have sort of a corporate standard software for statistical analysis, Minitab. I don't have much experience with it but attended a training seminar a few months ago and have been trying it out for smaller things here and there. I did an analysis this week with the tools I normally use (Ruby and Matlab). I decided to go back and try the same analysis using Minitab to see if there was anything to gain by using it instead. I was very surprised. I had a few hurdles to get over to get Minitab to do what I wanted, but once I did it was much faster than Matlab, or even excel. </p>
<p>Minitab is a great tool for statistical analysis. I have to say it is much better than Matlab or Excel. I will be using it much more in the future.</p>
