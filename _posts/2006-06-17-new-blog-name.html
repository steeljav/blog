<p>Note the new blog name. My grandfather is retired from Northwestern Steel and Wire. My father spent 29 years at Northwestern, and I worked there while I was in college. My brother worked there, my mom worked there, my uncles worked there. I have been around steel most of my life. </p>
<p>I have been thinking about changing the name for a while. When I thought of the single thread name, it had to do with only being able to focus on one thing at a time (I still have that problem). And also, at that time I was primarily a programmer. I haven't been a programmer in several years now, and I don't really miss it (except for some of the cool people I worked with). To me, programming is just a tool, a means to get at a solution, very much like mathematics.</p>
<p>Anyway, the new name better reflects where I am at right now, and where I plan to be for a long time to come. If I ever get the time, I will probably redo the blog a bit, and create a new favicon.</p>
<p>Comments?</p>
