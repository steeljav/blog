<p>I have to write a program for a <a href="http://www.icaen.uiowa.edu/~recog/HWK/probs.html">homework assignment</a> for a masters class that I am taking. The instructor gave us the choice of language to use for the program with the stipulation that the language had to be installed on the engineering computers. Unfortunately, Ruby is not there. So, choosing the lesser of the evils I am using Perl.</p>
<p>I used to really like Perl, until I learned Ruby. I am trying to do some thing with data structures that would be so, so, so easy and clean in Ruby. In Perl it is difficult, painful and error prone. At least IMHO.</p>
<p>With Ruby I feel like a ninja. With Perl I feel like a Sumo wrestler. They are both powerful, but I would prefer to be a ninja.</p>
