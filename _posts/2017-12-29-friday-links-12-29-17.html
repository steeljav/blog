<p>BBC travel had a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170215-living-in-the-worlds-most-welcoming-countries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post describing a few cities most welcoming to expats</a>. This was published back in February but I bumped into it again somehow.</p>
<p>The AISI released <a href="http://www.steel.org/~/media/Files/AISI/Press%20Releases/2017/IMP1711.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> showing US steel imports are up 18% YTD through November.</p>
<p>The Soviets built a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171018-the-soviet-unions-flawed-rival-to-concorde" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rival to the Concorde</a>. It was a failure, but still impressive.</p>
