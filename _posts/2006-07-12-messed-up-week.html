<p>I made a quick trip out to Jersey Sunday, and came back home Monday night. It kind of wore me out. It takes most of the day to get to/from Newark from Moline. </p>
<p>Since I started working on Sunday morning this week, I am all messed up. It really feels like it should be Friday or something. I would really like to take Friday off, but I have a commitment at work and I won't be able to.</p>
