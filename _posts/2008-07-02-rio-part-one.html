This is a picture of me with Ipanema beach in the background. It is winter time in Brazil, so as you can see, the beaches were not very crowded.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.billybryant.net/pics/copacabana.jpg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2008/07/copacabana.jpg" alt="pic" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 4px 0;" width="120" height="90"></a>This is a picture of Copacabana beach. Again, it is winter so it isn't too crowded. I kept telling my colleagues that they should call it something besides winter. Sunny and 85 just isn't winter in my book. I think that if I were planning a vacation in Rio, I would probably stay on the Copacabana side of the beaches. It seems to be more developed and seems to have more hotels, restaurants, shops etc. It is about a half mile walk to Ipanema and Leblon if you want to go to those beaches. I didn't make it to Botafogo but I think it is just on the other side of Copacabana.</p>
<p>As always in Brazil, the food, beers and Caipirinha's were excellent and the people were friendly.</p>
