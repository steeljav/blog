<p>Finally, 2009 and the 00's are gone. What a year, 2010 has to be better.</p>
<p>Woke up this morning at 0500 and took the dog outside. It was a clear crisp morning with an almost full moon. It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. It was 3F (-16C) outside but it didn't really feel that cold because the humidity was very low. One of the nice things about winter in the Midwest is that it is usually dry and you don't feel the cold so much like in other places that have constant high humidity.</p>
<p>The humidity was higher yesterday and it felt a lot colder. I was thinking about New Years Eve 1994. I was in the <a href="http://www.af.mil">USAF</a> and stationed at <a href="http://www.spangdahlem.af.mil/">Spangdahlem AB</a> in Germany. I took one of many trips to Paris to spend the New Years holiday. I remember walking along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine">River</a> <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=river+seine&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=Ouk9S9uSIofcNuuMzIgJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB4QsAQwAw">Seine</a> and being very, very cold. That was without a doubt the coldest trip that I ever took to Paris. For some reason the small breakfasts that I had on that trip are very memorable. They were not anything special, typical small French breakfast, coffee and croissant with butter, jelly and maybe some cheese. The coffee was phenomenal, or maybe I was just cold and it hit the spot.</p>
<p>That was the only bus trip I ever took to Paris. I don't recommend taking a bus trip to Paris, it was very constraining. If you are going to travel to Paris from other parts of Europe I recommend either taking the train, flying or renting a car and driving. If you rent a car and drive my advice is to park outside of the city (it is much cheaper) and take the train into the city where you can use the Paris metro system. It has been a while but it used to be reasonable to park at Euro-Disney and take the train from there to the city.</p>
