<p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Done-Wrong-Woefully-Complete/dp/1593276206/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465742754&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=statistics+done+wrong" target="_blank">Statistics Done Wrong</a> yesterday. It's a good read and I highly recommend it if you useÂ hypothesis testing and inferential stats. My copy is highlighted, scribbled in and dog-eared already.</p>
<p>On the one hand I was surprised and disappointed by the magnitude and frequency of errors in application and interpretation of statistics that is detailed in the book. Most of the case studies are in social, biological and medical sciences. On the other hand I'm not really surprised. I say this because the proper application of hypothesis testing and inferential stats is nuanced and very easy to get wrong.</p>
<p>The book provides some great practical advice with several examples of application and interpretation. I plan to adapt one of the examples to an application of EAF process improvement and post it here. I see some of these errors frequently.</p>
