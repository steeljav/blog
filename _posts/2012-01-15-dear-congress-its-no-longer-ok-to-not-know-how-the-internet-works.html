<p>Found a link to <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/2011/12/16/dear-congress-it-s-no-longer-ok-to-not-know-how-the-internet-works">this</a> on the <a href="http://www.nycresistor.com/">NYC Resistor</a> page. The title pretty much sums it up. I suppose a footnote saying something like "<em>just because it is currently legal to take money to advance policy on behalf of third parties doesn't make it ethical</em>" might be in order also.</p>
