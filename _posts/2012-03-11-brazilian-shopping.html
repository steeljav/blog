<p>The AP published <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_BRAZIL_SUPERPOWER_OF_SHOPPING?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-03-11-04-08-47">an article</a> describing how newly minted Brazilian middle class are coming to the US to shop. This brought back memories of my former Brazilian colleagues going on buying binges at Best Buy and stuffing their luggage with electronics to take home. After going to Brazil and seeing how much electronics and luxury goods cost it was understandable. The inflation in pricing is due to luxury type taxes.</p>
