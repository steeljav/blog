<p>Here are some facts from the weekend edition of the Wall Street Journal: </p>
<ul>
<li>46% of the world's population live in "free" societies, which is up 26% from 1977. Of the 18 Middle Eastern and North African countries, only Israel is considered free.</li>
<li>The US State Dept. has named 42 groups to its list of designated foreign terrorist organizations. Of those, at least 5 have a home base in Lebanon.</li>

<li>Isreal has received nearly <b><u>49 Billion</u></b> in US foreign aid between 1960 and 2004, more than any other country. Egypt has received 43 Billion.</li>
<li>Before the start of the conflict there were an estimated 25,000 US citizens living in Lebanon. About 14,600 have been transported out of Lebanon.</li>
