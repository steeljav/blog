<p>Steve Irwin was killed while making an underwater documentary. Supposedly he was stung through the chest by a Stingray. Coverage <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/04/australia.irwin/index.html?section=cnn_topstories">here</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5311298.stm"> here</a>, and <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/03/steve_crocodile_hunt.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I really feel bad for his family. I wasn't a huge fan, but I respected him for his professionalism and his passion for his field.</p>
