<p>Read <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-still-use-vim-67afd76b4db6%20and%20thought%20I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> yesterday from a link on google+. I started using <a href="http://vim.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vim</a> years ago when I was learning Linux. It is a programmer's text editor and I realized the full potential when I started working as a Software Engineer for Lockheed. You can move mountains with a few keystrokes if you put the time into learning. I finally started using an awesome <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IDE</a> for java development, but I still use vim for miscellaneous things daily.</p>
