<p>I have struggled with keeping select sets of data synchronized between multiple PCs and backups of that data up to date. Over the years I have utilized <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> along with various scripts. Last week I decided to spend some time looking for a tool that will handle this for me with minimum effort. I considered <a href="https://www.getsync.com/">bit torrent sync</a> but then found <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">unison</a> which is an open source solution and so decided to use it instead.</p>
<p>The software is well documented and I was able to have it working in an hour. It wouldn't have taken this long but the version supplied by my linux distribution didn't match the Mac version and so I had to compile it from source. No issues other than that and it works great.</p>
