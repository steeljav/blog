<p>The weather in Iowa is absolutely perfect today. We finally were able to open our windows. It is supposed to be in the low 80's today. It feels pretty good after being in SouthEast Texas last week, and also the heat wave that went through the midwest over the last week. It would be nice if it stayed this way for a few weeks.</p>
