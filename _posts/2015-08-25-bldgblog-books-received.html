<p>I came across <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/books-received.html">this</a> list of books put together by <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/">bldgblog</a>. If you're looking for something to read this is quite a decent list to pick from with some really interesting sounding books I haven't heard of. I will probably add a few from this to my list.</p>
