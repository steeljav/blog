<p>BBC Future has an <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170816-the-monster-atomic-bomb-that-was-too-big-to-use">article</a> about a nuclear weapon developed and tested by the Soviet's in 1961.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Tsar Bomba unleashed almost unbelievable energy – now widely agreed to be in the order of 57 megatons, or 57 million tons of TNT. That is more than 1,500 times that of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs combined, and 10 times more powerful than all the munitions expended during World War Two. Sensors registered the bomb’s blast wave orbiting the Earth not once, not twice, but three times."</p></blockquote>
<p>That's an unbelievable amount of energy. I'm guessing some people in Washington ended up working a lot of hours for the next few weeks after that detonation.</body></html></p>
