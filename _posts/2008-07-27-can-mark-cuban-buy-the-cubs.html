<p>There is a <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/mariotti/1076445,mariotti072708.article">nice story</a> in the <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/index.html">Chicago Sun Times</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban">Mark Cuban</a> trying to buy the Cubs. He has put in an opening bid of $1.2 Billion! (Its the Cubs, they are worth every penny of it). And it goes on to talk about the stupid good-old-boy club political power that the owners and the owner/commisioner yield and how it is very unlikely they would allow a guy like Mark to buy the Cubs.</p>
<p>Mark is cool. He goes to Wrigley and watches games from the bleachers. There is no doubt he would commit the time, resources and money to ensure that the Cubs are always contenders. I think every Cubs fan would agree that he would be the best owner. Unfortunately, it probably can't happen.</p>
<p>I love the game, I absolutely despise the business/politics end of it.</p>
