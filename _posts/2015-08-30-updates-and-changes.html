<p>It's probably a bit obvious, I have been posting things to this weblog lately. I have had a lot of things piling up that I wanted to post about but kept putting off. Writing on this weblog is something I enjoy and need to make time to do. I feel like the more time spent writing, the better you are at it and it is an important skill, maybe one of the most important considering the amount of communication that is accomplished using electronic communication today.</p>
<p>I intend to make a few small modifications to the look of the website over the next month or so. Wordpress is great for some things, but I don't feel that it is the easiest in terms of customization and I have had issues with minor changes. The content should always be available but the look may be problematic. I will have things resolved as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience.</p>
