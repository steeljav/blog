<p>well, again I tried to edit one of my movable type files directly and the changes did not survive a blog post. Apparently, the files are rebuilt every post or something. Looks like to make changes to templates you have to go through the web interface of the blog. That kind of sucks for me because I really like using <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> to edit configuration files.</p>
<p>There is probably a way to do it, I just don't know it yet. Maybe I have something configured wrong? Hard to say at this point.</p>
