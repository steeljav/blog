<p>Well, The masters thesis is more or less finished. I delivered it to my advisor last week. So, I can not make any more changes at this point. Here is a <a href="http://www.billybryant.net/docs/thesis.pdf">link to the thesis</a>. I will put a permanent link in the sidebar when I have more time.</p>
