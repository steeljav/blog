<p>There was a question on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/19cqxch/in_search_of_reports_or_books_on_berlin_airports/">Berlin subreddit</a> for reports or book references. I immediately thought of the <a href="https://www.radiospaetkauf.com/ber/">"how to fuck up an airport"</a> podcast series that was the first response. It is quite entertaining and sad at the same time. Check it out if you haven't heard it and have interest.</p>

<p>There is a good <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bau_des_Flughafens_Berlin_Brandenburg">wikipedia article</a> (in German).</p>
