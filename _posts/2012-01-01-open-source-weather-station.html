<p>Several years ago I started development of an open source weather station. I haven't worked on development of it since around 2003, but I have received multiple e-mails through the years asking for the source code and documentation. The source code is (and has been) located on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">sourceforge</a> since I released it, and can be downloaded <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxmonitor">here</a>. I also set up a web page for the project which contains all of the documentation and is located <a href="http://wxmonitor.sourceforge.net">here</a>.</p>
<p>Have to hand it to sourceforge, years of no activity on this project and everything is still there. Enjoy.</p>
