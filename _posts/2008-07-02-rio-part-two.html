The place was a bar in a poor neighborhood in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=campo+grande+-+RJ,+Brazil&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-22.898948,-43.547745&amp;spn=0.293495,0.368042&amp;z=11">this town.</a>My colleagues advised me to only eat the sardines and only drink the beer. I took their advice. As you can see, the sardines were fresh and basically butterflied and deep fried. They were pretty good. The only problem I had with them was that some ofthe bones were still there. They were soft, but you had to chew them up a little. I didn't really feel comfortable swallowing the bones, it just didn't feel right to me because I have never eaten fish that way. This little bar was absolutely packed with people waiting in line to get in. Everyone was eating the sardines. I have no idea how they found this place.</p>

From there you have a nice view of Cristo Redemptor (Christ the Redemer) on top of Corcovado. The sun was setting and I was able to get some nice pictures.</p>
