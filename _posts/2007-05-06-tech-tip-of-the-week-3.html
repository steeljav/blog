<p>I hate using a mouse. I find that it slows me down quite a bit. When I used to sling code (software engineering) for a living, I had my Linux box at work set up to basically be mouseless. Linux/Unix is very easy to use mousless. Windows on the other hand isn't quite so easy.</p>
<p>This weeks tip is about highlighting text. Usually people use the mouse to do this as part of a copy/cut/paste operation. In just about every windows application, you can highlight text by holding down the shift key and moving the cursor with the left/right/up/down arrows. I find it is pretty useful to do this.</p>
