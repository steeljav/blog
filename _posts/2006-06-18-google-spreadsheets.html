<p>This is a little bit old, but google has an <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=wise&amp;passive=true&amp;nui=1&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Fccc%3Fnew">online spreadsheet service</a>, which is pretty cool. I had to e-mail them and say that I was interested, and then they replied and I was able to use it. I guess it is another one of their services that may be in beta for the next 2 years. I expect that they will be offering some sort of word clone in the near future as well.</p>
<p>I think google can really make a dent in Microsoft's cash cow (office), but they are going to really need to do some work on the privacy end of it. I don't think that too many corporations are going to get into using the service if Google is parsing the documents, like they do with e-mail.</p>
