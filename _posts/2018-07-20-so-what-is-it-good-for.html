<p>From a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-is-right-about-trade-with-china-but-his-answer-is-all-wrong/2018/07/20/24f4755e-86c0-11e8-9e80-403a221946a7_story.html?__twitter_impression=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true&amp;utm_term=.83094c0e0992">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dennis Shea, the U.S. ambassador to the WTO, said the body was incapable of policing China’s behavior.</p>
<p>Many of the Chinese policies that the United States objects to — such as subsidies that promote excess capacity in steel and aluminum production — are not prohibited by WTO rules, Shea acknowledged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and how long has it taken our politicians to figure this out and how much damage has been done to our economy during that period?</p>
