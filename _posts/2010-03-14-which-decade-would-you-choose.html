<p>I was watching something on TV the other day where a guy was accidentally sucked into something like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wormhole"> Einstein-Rosen Bridge</a> and woke up in 1970 something. This got me thinking a little (it happens sometimes). If I were an engineer (I am) in approximately 1970: </p>
<ul>
<li>I would not be typing this on my nice shiny Linux box for you to read over a global computer network.</li>
<li>I would not be using e-mail to communicate with people.</li>
<li>I would have to use the library a lot more than I already do.</li>
<li>I would have to be much better with a slide rule than I am.</li>
<li>I suspect that I would have more free time.</li>
<li>In the USA my standard of living would be higher than it is today (a sad fact supported by data).</li>
<li>I could still live in the house I live in today, it was built in 1918.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, my question is if you could choose a decade to spend your 20's, 30's, 40's or whatever, which decade would it be and why? Would you choose the place you currently reside, or would it be in a different city, state, country, continent?</p>
