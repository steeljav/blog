<p>I was able to finish up my perl script for the most part. I took a little while, but I remembered that perl is ok as long as you keep all of your data structures flat. You don't have to do that, but the dereferencing syntax gets rough really fast if you don't. Try an array of hashes sometime, to dereference it, it is something like @AoH[0]-&gt;{'key'}. In Ruby it would be what your brain thinks it should be (Ruby's element of least surprise) which is aoh[0]['key']. I know which one I'll choose, given a choice.</p>
