<p>When I was in Brazil last month, I was having dinner and realized that basically everything on my plate could be considered Brazilian food. Yes, there is of course a Portuguese influence, but I think most Brazilian food is unique/original. I got to thinking about the countries that I have been to and how most of the food in those countries was unique to their country/culture.</p>
<p>I started trying to think about what foods the USA has that could be considered ours. I dicsussed this with some colleagues, but could not come up with much. Here is the list: </p>
<ol>
<li>Buffalo Wings</li>
<li>Barbeque (Texas, KC, etc.)</li>
<li>Cobb Salad? (I love these).</li>
</ol>
<p> So that is all we could come up with. Everything else that we could think of and that we eat on a regular basis came from someplace else.
<p>So, my question for anyone reading this is what other foods/dishes do we eat in the USA that we could say are ours?</p>
