<p>I went to the chiropracter again today. I have to go back on Friday I'm not sure that it is helping much. I think that it would have healed on its own. I just wanted to have someone check it out. </p>
<p>My chiropracter doesn't say much. He always seems like he is in a hurry to get me out of there. But today he said that I should be putting some ice on it at night. He says that the muscles in my back are short and tight from lifting and not stretching, so after he does the adjustments the muscles are tightening back up to protect the injured area and that is why it hurts. Ice is supposed to help with that.</p>
<p>My appointment was at 1630 today. I think it was about 1650 by the time that I got in. One of the few pet peaves that I have is when I have an appointment someplace and I am on time and I end up waiting around for an extra 20 or 30 minutes. They know that they are running behind, they should call you so you don't waste your time.</p>
