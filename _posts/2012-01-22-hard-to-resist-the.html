<a href="http://stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a> noted that former senator Chris Dodd who "promised" in 2010 to not become a lobbyist <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/01/18/chris_dodds_paid_sopa_crusading/singleton/">is the highest paid SOPA lobbyist</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>For democracy's sake, we must close the revolving door between government and industry. Anyone who has been an elected official, or a high official in any branch of government, should not be allowed to lobby for 10 years after. And this must include any sort of business position aimed substantially at influencing government policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree but believe that we need to go farther than this by getting the money (i.e. campaign donations) out of politics (publicly financed campaigns) and instituting term limits on congress.</body></html></p>
