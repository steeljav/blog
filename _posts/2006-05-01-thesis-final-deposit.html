<p>I turned in the final deposit of my thesis today. Now I guess they spend some time reviewing it for the formatting. It's strange, I have been more concerned with the graduate college hasseling me over the damn formatting of this thing than I have been with my thesis committee reviewing it. </p>
<p>Last week of classes also. I will be glad to be done. I have a final in my optimization course next Wed., and then it is off to the airport to go to New Jersey for a day.</p>
