<p>The annual <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2006/top100/">Money top 100 places to live</a> is out. The top five are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Fort Collins, Co</li>
<li>Naperville, Il</li>
<li>Sugar Land, Tx</li>
<li>Columbia/Ellicott City, Md</li>
<li>Cary, Nc</li>
</ol>
<p> Just to note, Eden Prairie, Mn came in at number ten and Eagan, Mn came in at number 12.
<p>I don't always agree with what Money comes up with. In this case, I deffinitely don't agree with Eden Prairie being in the top 10, and Eagan being number 12. I worked in Eagan for 2 years. Don't get me wrong, they are very nice places, like most of the Twin Cities suburbs, but in my opinion, the traffic and expense of the places ruin it. I would basically say the same thing for Naperville, Il, I lived right next to Naperville for about 6 months.</p>
<p>A lot of the top 100 places were in Texas. I can believe this. Texas is affordable, not crowded, has decent weather for the most part, no State tax, and jobs. As I have said before, I would not have a problem relocating to Texas.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that on the list of most educated cities, Iowa City, Ia came in at number 14 with 27.4 percent of the population having graduate degrees. This is where the University of Iowa is at, and where I got my MSEE.</p>
