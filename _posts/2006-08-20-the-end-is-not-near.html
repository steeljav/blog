<p>Last week I said that I thought the end of summer travel was near. I take it back. There were a lot of people out this weekend.</p>
<p>I left Perth Amboy, NJ this morning at 0530. I thought that would absolutely be plenty of time to get the car back, get checked in, and get through the Newark airport security for an 0800 flight. Everything would have been fine, except that there was only one train going between the terminals and parking, and a whole lot of people trying to get out of Jersey. By the time I got to my gate, it was 0730. I couldn't believe it.</p>
