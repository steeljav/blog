<p>We had some pretty serious storms last night. Lots of lightning and hail. There were <a href="http://www.billybryant.net/ict.ppt">tornadoes nearby in Iowa City</a> and as a result, I didn't have class today at the U of Iowa. It also <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WEATHER/04/14/severe.weather.ap/index.html">made CNN.</a>  We lucked out and didn't have any major damage to our house in Muscatine. We had a second story storm window get broke from hail. I am not sure how our kitchen window did not get broken. The hail was really hitting it hard, it was very loud. We got the kids out of bed around 9:30 and went into the basement for about 30 minutes while the really bad stuff blew over.  It's that time of the year again.</p>
