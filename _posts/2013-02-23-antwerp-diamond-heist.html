<p>Last week in Antwerp eight robbers were able to infiltrate the airport, stop an airplane, retrieve $50M worth of diamonds and escape in under 5 minutes. This has been all over the news you can google it if you haven't read the details yet. The Belgian authorities do not have any suspects in custody at this time. I recommend they start by questioning Robert De Niro. It sounds like a movie he would star in.</p>
