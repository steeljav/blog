<p>The BBC has an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8420089.stm"> article</a> about the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search being conducted at the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/soudan_underground_mine/index.html"> Soudan National Mine</a> in Minnesota. Fermilab may have detected dark matter. I hope so, this is the experiment that I had the opportunity to participate in as an undergraduate at <a href="http://www.niu.edu">NIU</a>. I wrote a bunch of Perl scripts to test the electronics that control the detectors.</p>
