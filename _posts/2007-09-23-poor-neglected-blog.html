<p>It has been a while since I have posted anything here. It is not for a lack of effort, I have tried, but I have been ridiculously busy. I should have some time to post some things this week. For now, this is what is on my mind: </p>
<ul>
<li>I have no doubt that the Cubs can make it to the world series if they continue to play like they played today. Today was the last day at Wrigley for the regular season.</li>
<li>How to utilize constrained optimization algorithms for optimal control problems without a gradient function. This has to be a common type of problem, but I am stuck.</li>
<li>A few weeks in Brasil would probably help my Portuguese much more than studying an hour or two a day.</li>
<li>KRUU in Fairfield Iowa seriously rocks on Sunday nights.</li>
<li>I have been getting a lot of spam lately. I got in touch with a few old friends recently and they added me to their mailing lists. I think that is why.</li>
</ul>
