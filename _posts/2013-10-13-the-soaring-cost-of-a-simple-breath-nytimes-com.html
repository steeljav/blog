<p>Reading an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/us/the-soaring-cost-of-a-simple-breath.html?hp&amp;_r=0">article</a> in the NYTimes this morning. From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks in part to the $250 million last year spent on lobbying for pharmaceutical and health products — more than even the defense industry — the government allows such practices. Lawmakers in Washington have forbidden Medicare, the largest government purchaser of health care, to negotiate drug prices. Unlike its counterparts in other countries, the United States Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which evaluates treatments for coverage by federal programs, is not allowed to consider cost comparisons or cost-effectiveness in its recommendations. And importation of prescription medicines from abroad is illegal, even personal purchases from mail-order pharmacies.</p>
