<p>If you haven't seen office space, I suggest you go rent it and you will understand the title of this post. My boss burried me in paperwork today. I did paperwork most of today and will be doing paperwork for the next few days. I know that it has to get done, but I don't want to be the one to do it.</p>
<p>One of the few good things about working for Lockheed Martin as an engineer was that you were just about completely insulated from the business end of everything. At this job I am completely involved with the business end of every project, and I would rather not be. I would prefer that the boss just tells me what he wants, when he wants it and how much I have to spend. That would work out great.</p>
