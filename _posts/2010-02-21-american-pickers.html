<p>I watched <a href="http://www.history.com/content/american-pickers"> American Pickers</a> last night for the first time. Someone suggested that I check it out. It didn't sound very interesting to me but I guess it was ok. I found out that their shop shop is just down the road from me in LeClaire Iowa, about 30 minutes away.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that there is so much "stuff" sitting around out in the middle of nowhere, and that the "stuff" actually has some monetary value.</p>
