<p>The <a href="http://wsj.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WSJ</a> has an article about the failure of renewable energy in Germany. Some interesting statistics:</p>
<blockquote><p>German households pay nearly 36 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour of electricity, versus an average of 13 cents in America</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow. And I thought Northern Illinois was high.</p>
<blockquote><p>A new study from the RWI Leibniz Institute for Economic Research finds that 61% of Germans wouldn’t want to pay even one eurocent more per kilowatt-hour of electricity to fund more renewables.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can't blame them.</p>
<blockquote><p>By one estimate, businesses and households paid an extra €125 billion in increased electricity bills between 2000 and 2015 to subsidize renewables, on top of billions more in other handouts. Germans join Danes in paying the highest household electricity rates in Europe, and German companies pay near the top among industrial users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet somehow they manage to maintain full employment plus and be globally competitive with a highly export oriented economy.</p>
