<p>I really haven't had much time to update the blog. I have a list of topics that I would like to talk about, but I have been travelling quite a bit. Sometimes when I am travelling I have time at night to do things like update the blog or whatever. But lately I haven't even had that time.</p>
<p>Some things that are on my mind lately: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Cubs got a new coach. Now they have a realistic chance at doing something. I will pay attention this season.</li>
<li>I am thinking that if I were to move to Chicago and be within 20 minutes or so of O'hare I could save about 8+ hours a week in travel time. I would be able to take a direct flight everywhere and would eliminate the 2 hop flights that I am always on now. Additionally, I think that I would have less delays. Small airports like Moline and Cedar Rapids always seem to be the first to get delays. I don't know if my employer would agree to it.</li>
<li>I am thinking about switching my main airline carrier to United. This would make all of my flights go through O'hare. There are a few reasons for doing this: O'hare has a Starbucks about every 100 yards, You can get Vienna beef Chicago style hot dogs at O'hare and if I get any really bad delays like I have at Minneapolis and Detroit, it is close enough that I could rent a car and drive home, or at least to my family in Whiteside/Lee counties.</li>
<li>I am ready for the holidays. I wish I had more vacation.</li>
<p>That is about it.</p>
</ul>
