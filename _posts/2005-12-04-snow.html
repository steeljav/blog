<p>We have about 6" of snow on the ground now. It snowed a few days last week. Hard to believe that we have this much snow on the ground this early. I haven't seen this happen in quite a while. Now that the ground is covered, it won't be able to get very warm. It is possible that we are going to have a long winter.</p>
