<p>The NY Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/business/entrepreneurs-starting-up-with-fewer-employees.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=general&amp;src=me">an article</a> about entrepreneurs starting up with less staff. The interesting thing is that the startup discusses the use of part time consultants for their specialization only and how this may be the future of work. I have worn so many hats for so long now that I just can't imagine being able to specialize in one or two areas. It would be a nice change of pace.</p>
