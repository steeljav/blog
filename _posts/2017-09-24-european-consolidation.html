<p>ThyssenKrupp and Tata finally got together. The BBC has some details <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-41329552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Thyssen's price jumped 5% and then continued it's previous decline (see chart). Hopefully this is good for the EU steel industry, unfortunately it will not be good for some of the workers.</p>
