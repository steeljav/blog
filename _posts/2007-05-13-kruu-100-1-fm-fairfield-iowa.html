<p>I was reading about <a href="http://kruufm.com/">KRUU</a> on <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc's Blog</a>. This is a really cool project. I live about 80 straight line miles from <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Fairfield</a>, probably too far to pick up their 100 Watt FM signal. But I think that I should get in touch with these guys and see if we can set up a repeater in Muscatine, or the Quad Cities, or at least volunteer some of my Linux/BSD/Electrical skills.</p>
<p>Commercial radio is so bad anymore that I can't stand to listen to anything besides NPR. Open source, community radio, it's about time.</p>
