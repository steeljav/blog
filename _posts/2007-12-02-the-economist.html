<p>My subscription to <a href="http://www.economist.com">The Economist</a> finally ran out. It is an excellent magazine if you are into following world events and economic issues. The problem that I had was that it was weekly (makes sense for news publications), and I could just not keep up with it. It looks like most of the content is available on-line also.</p>
