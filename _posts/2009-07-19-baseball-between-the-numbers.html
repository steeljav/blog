<p>I am currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Between-Numbers-Everything-About/dp/B001W6RRX4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1248040433&amp;sr=8-1">Baseball Between The Numbers.</a> This book is excellent. If you are looking for something to read covering statistical analysis of baseball, this is it. The depth of knowledge and analysis is phenomenal.</p>
