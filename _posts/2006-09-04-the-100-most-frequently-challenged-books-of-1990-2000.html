<p>The <a href="http://www.ala.org">American Library Association</a> has a list of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 1990-2000 <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.htm"> here</a>. They also have a list of the 100 most challenged books of 1990-1999 <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/top100challenged.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>I came across this because I started reading "The Catcher In the Rye" and I was just browsing around online about it. I didn't realize that it was so controversial.</p>
<p>I think that it is cool that the ALA is keeping track of these things.</p>
