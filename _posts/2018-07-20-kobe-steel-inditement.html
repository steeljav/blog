<p>The <a href="http://wsj.com">WSJ</a> reported that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-kobe-steel-indicted-over-quality-scandal-1531997704">Kobe Steel has been indicted</a>Â in Japan on the ongoing quality falsification scandal. No specific executives were indicted and the maximum penalty is $2.7 million. Seems like a slap on the wrist for decades of falsification, but this is probably just the tip of the iceberg of their legal issues.</p>
