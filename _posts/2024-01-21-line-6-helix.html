<p>I've noted multiple times in this blog that I have played guitar since I was a kid and <strong>I am still going to be a rock star when I grow up</strong>.</p>

<p>When I was in the USAF in <a href="https://www.spangdahlem.af.mil">Germany</a> I spent way too much money on a Digitech effects processor. I guess it was probably cutting edge for 1995 but was such a piece of garbage that I would never even consider Digitech gear today.</p>

<p>I finally broke down and bought a line 6 helix last year. For the $$ it is an incredible piece of gear. I won't go into details reviewing it because there are plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RiffsAndBeards">other</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SteveSterlacci">people</a> that have done that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JasonSadites">way better</a> than I ever could. It's awesome that guitar gear has come so far in terms of affordability and quality.</p>

<p>Can't imagine how nice it would have been to have a Helix when I was 16, 17, ..</p>
