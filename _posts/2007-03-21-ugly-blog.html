<p>I am starting to think that this blog could win a contest for the ugliest blog on the internet. I would like to make some changes to it, but just have not had the time.</p>
<p>This blog is called <a href="https://rubyforge.org/projects/rublog/">Rublog</a>, which is short for Ruby Blog (I think?). It is cool because it is really easy to set up, and it is Ruby based. The one thing that I would like to see added to it is a more standard comment feature. If I had the time, I would add it myself.</p>
