<p>My host asked me if I wanted to try some Mexican sushi for supper. I said sure. We went to a sushi joint which happens to be directly across the street from the hotel. He calls it Mexican sushi because it is not really sushi. The stuff we had was serrano pepper, avocado, cream cheese and some kind of meat rolled up and deep fried. Not really sushi. I didn't care because I am not much of a sushi fan anyway.</p>
<p>I had thought earlier in the day today that we might be able to finish up tomorrow, but I don't see that happening now. We are going to need the whole week. </p>
<p>Earlier today we were talking about another project they are working on with another steel company. They are doing sort of the same thing for them as they are for us. He said that they were very involved in the specification of the software and wanted it to be very detailed and would not sign off on it until they were satisfied. I wish that I could get that level of involvement from my colleagues. I am sure that they will bitch if/when they don't get what they want, but they signed off on the specs. so I am CYA'd. Despite their lack of involvement, I think this is going to turn out to be a decent system (as long as we devote the resources to the configuration and maintenance of it, training, process tuning, etc.). I am really glad that I scheduled this week to come down here and go over everything in detail. We have sorted out a lot of minute details that would have been missed. I'm not sure that the system will meet the original expectations, but those expectations were probably unrealistic to begin with. They were set by people who know very little about systems and software and their limitations.</p>
