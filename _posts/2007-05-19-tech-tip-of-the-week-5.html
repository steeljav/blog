<p>I am in a hurry, so this tip will be short and sweet.</p>
<p>This weeks tip is another google tip to go with last weeks. If you tell google to search for "movies xxxxx", where xxxxx is your zip code, you will get movie times for theaters in that area. For example, if I type "movies 61071", without the quotes of course, I get the showtimes for my home town. Enjoy.</p>
