<p>This weeks Economist magazine has <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21685519-lights-are-going-out-night-clubs-all-over-europe-less-ecstatic" target="_blank">an article</a> discussing how techno clubs are declining. Kind of hard to believe for me. I went to some of these huge clubs when I was stationed in Germany in the early 90's. I didn't care for electronic music back then (I do now), but the clubs were cool. I've been told that Prague is the hotspot nowadays. I have a colleague in the EU that goes there frequently because there are more clubs, better clubs, bigger clubs etc. and it is cheap.</p>
