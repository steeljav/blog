<p>My trip home last night was terrible. I went to Charlotte for a few days. I flew from Charlotte to Detroit to Moline. The trip to Detroit was absolutely packed, every seat filled due to about 100 or so people flying standby. Why do people fly standby? I don't understand it at all. You know where you want to go, when you want to get there, you buy a ticket. It's that simple right? The flight from Detroit to Moline was rough, two screaming kids in front of me, some guy next to me crying, and every seat filled. It was a long trip home.</p>
<p>I was thinking about the worst flight I have ever been on yesterday on the way home. It is without a doubt a flight on a C-130 when I was in the Air Force. It is a longer story, and I will make a seperate post for it.</p>
