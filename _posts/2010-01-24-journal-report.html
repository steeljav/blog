<p>The <a href="http://www.wsj.com">WSJ</a> included their <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704675104575001513390059620.html#articleTabs%3Darticle">"Journal Report"</a> in the Wednesday (1/20/2010) edition. It included some interesting commentary and opinion about what the future of the US may look like. Dr Martin Feldstein, a Harvard Economist wrote: </p>
<p class="quote">The International Monetary Fund estimates that annual U.S. budget deficits will be about 7 percent of GDP from 2012 through the end of the decade. Such deficits would absorb virtually all of the nation's household and business saving, thus reducing the funds available for business investment and housing construction that are needed to raise productivity and our standard of living. It will also keep the U.S. dependent on inflows of funds from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Not a rosy outlook.</p>
