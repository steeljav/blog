<p>Well, I can't say I didn't see this one coming. I remember talking to colleagues and friends in 2003 about how I felt that housing prices would come down, that the escalation of prices just didn't make sense. They didn't agree.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that the combination and consequences of escalating prices, and cheap credit could be this extreme. From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/business/22talkshow.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin">NY Times</a> </p>
