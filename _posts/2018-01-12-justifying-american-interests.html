<p>The economist has <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21734469-being-worlds-trade-policeman-tough-work-donald-trumps-difficult-decision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article</a> discussing the section 232 action and President Trump's options. I've been reading a lot of these types of articles lately and I keep asking why is it that they are written in a way suggesting that America must justify protecting it's own interests (i.e. domestic steel production, jobs, healthy middle class, open transparent fair business competition, etc.)?</p>
<p>Reuters has a similar (but much more neutral) article <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-steel/u-s-commerce-dept-sends-trump-steel-probe-findings-keeps-details-under-wraps-idUSKBN1F104T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Â From the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Critics charge that using national security to erect steel tariffs could trigger a trade war with China</p></blockquote>
<p>Tariffs wouldn't be necessary if the Chinese government would privatize it's industry and quit subsidizing it, as in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">honest, fair, competition</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>undermine the global rules-based trading system</p></blockquote>
<p>The global rules-based trading system isn't working. American steel companies have to compete with a communist state.</p>
<blockquote><p>and hurt U.S. allies more than China</p></blockquote>
<p>Only if we allow it to. It doesn't have to.</p>
<blockquote><p>and damage global growth prospects.</p></blockquote>
<p>And maybe America protecting it's interests will result in a cosmic planetary collision, but there's a lot of uncertainty in that conclusion.</body></html></p>
