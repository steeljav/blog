<p>Finished reading Moby Dick this morning. I thought that we had read an abridged version of this in high school but we must have read something else. I came across <a href="http://Finished%20reading%20Moby%20Dick%20this%20morning.%20I%20thought%20that%20we%20had%20read%20an%20abridged%20version%20of%20this%20in%20high%20school%20but%20we%20must%20have%20read%20something%20else.%20I%20came%20across%20this%20while%20looking%20around%20on%20line%20for%20other%20novels%20similar%20to%20Moby%20Dick.%20The%20story%20of%20the%20whaler%20Essex%20was%20what%20we%20read%20about,%20but%20I%20don't%20think%20any%20novels%20(besides%20Moby%20Dick)%20were%20written%20about%20it.%20We%20must%20have%20just%20read%20an%20article%20describing%20the%20incident%20or%20something%20similar." target="_blank">this</a> while looking around on line for other novels similar to Moby Dick. The story of the whaler Essex was what we read about, but I don't think any novels (besides Moby Dick) had been written about it at that time. We must have just read an article describing the incident or something similar. Time to find a new book.</p>
