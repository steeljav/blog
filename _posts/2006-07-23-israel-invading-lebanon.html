<p>Reading this morning's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/world/AP-Lebanon-Israel.html?hp&amp;ex=1153713600&amp;en=59d97e19d737bae2&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">New York Times</a>, it looks like Israeal and Lebanon/Hezbollah are going to continue fighting. This is too bad. I do not understand the dynamics of the situation very well. Why does Lebanon allow Hezbollah to fight Israel from their Southern border?</p>
<p>When I was in Turkey in 1993 and 1994 I tried to go to Beirut. But I could not find a way to get there. My understanding of it is that Beirut was a very beautiful city at one time where many European tourists came for vacation, and it was more or less destroyed during the Lebanese civil war.</p>
