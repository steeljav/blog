<p>I have been playing around with MT's layout. I wanted to change the widths on the content and the sidebar. I don't really like what they did for the default setup. They used numeric values to set the widths. I am pretty sure that you can use a percentage value in the css width specifier. I will play around with it some more and post something here if I am successful.</p>
