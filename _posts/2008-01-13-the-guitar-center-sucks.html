<p>My wife bought a practice amp for me for Christmas from the guitar center. When she picked it up, they gave her a large box which actually contained 2 of the practice amps. We didn't realize this until we opened it at Christmas. I wanted to do the right thing and return the extra amp. I expected that they would at least give us some sort of coupon for 20% off or something. They barely even said thanks. I couldn't believe it.</p>
