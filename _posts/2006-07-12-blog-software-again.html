<p>I have been looking for blog software some more. I am going to have to roll my own to get what I want. That really sucks. I don't want to do it. I don't have time to do it.</p>
<p>So what's wrong with Moveable Type? It is bloated perl code that doesn't run good on old/cheap servers. I also don't care for having to use their template system to modify the look and feel of the blog. I would really prefer to just edit files.</p>
<p>If it were not for wanting to have comments on the blog, I could have something reasonable written in an afternoon or so.</p>
