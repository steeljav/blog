<p>I was reading about the unanimous UN security council resolution against North Korea at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/10/14/nkorea.sanctions/index.html?section=cnn_topstories">CNN</a>. Read the key provisions column. What a joke. I am trying to figure out what sanctions they actually imposed. Some of these are things that should have been imposed already anyway. I fully expect North Korea to laugh at these "sanctions" and continue developing their nuclear arsenal.</p>
