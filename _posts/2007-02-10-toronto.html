<p>I spent last week east of Toronto. It was about the same temperature as home, but the wind was brutal. I am pretty sure that the wind was colder than anything I have ever felt in Chicago. I also got a little bit of a cold from my 5 year old, and it didn't help.</p>
<p>Toronto seems like a really nice place. My colleagues there tell me that the cost of living is high though. I am sure that it is.</p>
<p>It seemed like jazz was very popular in Toronto. There were a lot of jazz stations on the radio.</p>
