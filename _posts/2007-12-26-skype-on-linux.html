<p>I have been using skype in and out on windows for a few months now and I am really impressed by how well it works. I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Premium-USB-Headset-980374-0403/dp/B0007SXHP0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1198700864&amp;sr=8-1">Logitech USB headset</a> to use with Skype and it also works very well. Unfortunately, when I plugged it into my Linux box, it didn't work. I was able to select the headset as the I/O device in Skype, but Skype was not able to hear me. Using alsamixer -c 1 showed that ALSA recognized the headset and that the mic gain was turned all the way down. All I needed to do was turn the mic gain up and everything works fine.</p>
<p>If you are considering Skype on Linux, Skype 1.4 with Debian testing and the Logitech 350 USB headset will work.</p>
