<p>I have a thing for large old trees, how could a person not. When I lived in Iowa there was a park down the street with a lot of ~200+ year old oaks. A neighbor had one of the largest, oldest oaks I have ever seen, but was damaged during a windstorm and had to be cut down. <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/how-to-accidentally-kill-a-400-year-old-tree">This</a> is a little sad.</p>
