<p>I have too much stuff to read. I currently have subscriptions to the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Wall Street Journal (Daily)</li>
<li>IEEE Spectrum (Monthly)</li>
<li>IEEE Controls Magazine (Quarterly)</li>
<li>Money Magazine (Monthly)</li>
<li>National Geographic (Monthly)</li>
<li>Smart Money (Monthly)</li>
<li>Wired (Monthly)</li>
<li>AIST Iron and Steel Technology (Monthly)</li>
<li>This Old House Magazine (Monthly)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more than I can keep up with. When I was traveling all of the time it was different, I had time to kill on flights, between flights, etc. That is not the case now. Some of these I receive as part of a professional membership (IEEE, AIST). I would not have subscribed to Wired but received it for free for buying stuff at Amazon (It is an excellent mag, don't get me wrong). I don't read the National Geographic much, I just feel like it is a classic American publication and want to support it.</p>
<p>I just received a notification from American Airlines that some of my miles would be expiring and that I could use miles for magazine subscriptions and it would make my account current (how convenient is that). So, having no choice, I used miles to subscribe to <a href="http://www.economist.com">The Economist</a>, an absolutely outstanding (as I have noted here before) <u>weekly</u> publication. There is no way I am going to be able to keep up with it.</p>
