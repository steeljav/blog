<p>The Cubs will be starting another season without the help of Kerry Wood. Wood was put on the 15 day DL for right shoulder problems again. Additionally, Mark Prior didn't make the starting rotation and was sent to the AAA Iowa team in Des Moines (I should really go see him pitch). My guess is that they will call up Prior to fill in for Wood.</p>
