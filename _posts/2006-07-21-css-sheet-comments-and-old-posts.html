<p>Hopefully tomorrow I will have time to pull the css stylesheet, and all of my old posts out the moveable type blog. It is going to be tough, because I have a lot of crap to catch up on, and I also have to go in to work for a few minutes.</p>
<p>I am not sure what is up with comments on this blog. Chad Fowler has them on his, but he must have added the feature himself and not commited it into the CVS tree. If you have any comments on posts, for now, you know how to get in touch with me if you are reading this, at least probably.</p>
