<p>John Bonham is my favorite percussionist. To me, Bonham wasn't just awesome when he played, he had a good sense of when not to play. So much of the music that I listen to sounds like it has the percusion forced onto it. I never get that feeling from a Zeppelin song.</p>
<p>On the way home tonight, we were listening to Stairway to Heaven. I'm not sure how many other drummers could have put percussion to that song without breaking it. In fact, I don't think that I have heard a single Zeppelin song that doesn't sound like it has a perfect drum line.</p>
<p>Just my $0.02.</p>
