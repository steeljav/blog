<p>The August edition of Money Magazine has their <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2007/top100/">annual best places to live</a> results for 2007. Coming in at #1 is Mddleton Wisconsin, a suburb of Madison where typical single family homes are about $325,000. Unfortunately the average American household income is about $60,000/yr. which makes $325,000 a real stretch. With good credit scores and some savings the typical household income would probably be able to purchase approximately $200,000 worth of home in todays lending environment. Considering the average American household income, all of Money's top 10 best places to live are out of reach. From the article: </p>

<p>There was a time not that long ago (~40 years) when a family could make a decent living in this country on one income. Those days are long gone, and what have we gained?</p>
