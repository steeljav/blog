<p>I am staying at the <a href="http://www.embassysuites.com/en/es/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=MSPAPES">Embassy Suites</a> in Minneapolis/St. Paul this week, and working up here for a few days. The hotel is great. Very nice inside, the suites are decent sized, there is a pool, they have open bar from 1730 until 1900 and most importantly they have Starbucks. But, there is one big problem with this hotel, they do not provide free internet access in the room. Internet access is wireless and costs $10.00/Day! I can not believe it. This is the first hotel that I have stayed in in a long time that did not offer free internet. Unbelievable. For me, this is a deal breaker. I will probably look around for something else next time.</p>
<p>I stayed at a $40/Night Best Western in the middle of nowhere and they provided free broadband.</p>
