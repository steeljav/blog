<p>It is finally nice enough out that we are able to open some of the 60+ windows in our house. It is obvious that this house was build before air conditioning (1918 to be exact). This house is very nice to live in when it is nice enough outside to open all of the windows. I have never been in a house that ventilated this well.</p>
<p>I am stuck inside today working on writing my masters thesis. Another couple of months and I should be done.</p>
