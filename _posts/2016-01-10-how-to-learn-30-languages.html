<p>Somehow I came across <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150528-how-to-learn-30-languages">this BBC article</a> a few weeks ago and it has been sitting in a browser tab waiting for me to read. It's Sunday morning and I'm closing tabs and so finally read it.</p>
<p>I am not fluent in a second language and it is something that really bothers me. As someone who has <b>struggled</b> to learn a second language via self study as an adult I think it's important to note that these people all seem to have learned through immersion (they lived someplace where the language is spoken) and started learning languages early in life.</p>
<p>I have noticed that immersion makes learning easier by a factor of at least 10. I spent a year or so studying Brazilian Portuguese as much as I could. I made several trips to Brazil for work during that time and found that I learned more in a week just by being there than I could learn in a month studying at home. It's possible to learn another language without moving and being immersed in it, but it is very difficult and is going to take much longer.</p>
