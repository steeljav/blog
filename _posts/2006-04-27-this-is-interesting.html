<p>Not sure where this came from, (I got it in an e-mail summary of steel industry news), but I thought it was pretty cool.</p>
<p>The American Iron and Steel Institute reported that for the second consecutive year in a row, the United States steel industry has achieved a new milestone in energy efficiency by reducing its energy intensity per ton of steel shipped by approximately 13.2% since 2002 thus expanding its reduction in energy intensity to 28% since 1990.</p>
<p>Because of the close relationship between energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, the industry’s aggregate carbon dioxide emissions per ton of steel shipped were reduced by 17%. Compared to the Kyoto Protocol’s call for an average 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2012, this means the American steel industry has already surpassed the Kyoto target by more than 240%.</p>
