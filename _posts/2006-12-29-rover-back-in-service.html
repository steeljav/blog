<p>I think that I have the land rover fixed. I changed the top 3 hoses on the cooling system, and replaced the pressure cap. I filled it back up with anti-freeze and took it on a 40 mile test drive. It seems to be running great, and there are no coolant leaks.</p>
<p>Since the entire engine is aluminum, I was a little worried about the heads and gaskets due to the overheat when the hose blew. My experience with aluminum heads is that they warp very easily when the engine is overheated. They don't have to warp much for the gasket to fail which can result in a cylinder full of anti-freeze. If that happens, you are in bad shape. I checked the oil, and it was fine so it looks like it is good to go.</p>
