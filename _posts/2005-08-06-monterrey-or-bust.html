<p>Finally, all packed and ready to split. Have to be at the Cedar Rapids airport about 0930 tomorrow. I should be able to pack a bag in about 10 minutes or less as much traveling as I have done. I guess I am getting rusty. At this time tomorrow night I should be kicking back in the warm Monterrey evening. The travel agency was only able to get a really expensive room at the <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ic/1/en/hd/mtyhb">usual hotel</a>. They have some rooms on the top floors that have balconies. I am hoping that I got one of those this time.</p>
