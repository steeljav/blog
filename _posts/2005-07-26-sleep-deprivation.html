<p>Woke up at 0200 again last night. I seem to do that at least once a week and it really messes up the week. I will be tired for the rest of the week now. When I finally did get back to sleep, I really had some wild dreams. I never got back to sleep totally, so they were those dreams where you are half awake and half asleep. But, I didn't have much control over the dream unfortunately, it could have been fun.</p>
<p>Somehow I managed to get up at 0500 and work out. Doing squats at 0500 really sucks. But if I don't do it in the morning, it will never happen.</p>
