<p>Well, I made it home through the holiday travel madness yesterday. My flight was only 1 hour late. I was in Memphis. I went to the airport pretty early just to be sure that I had enough time to get through the traffic and lines. It was no problem. About 1400 everything got pretty crazy.</p>
<p>I have made a note to myself not to travel the day before the Christmas holiday anymore. It is too risky.</p>
