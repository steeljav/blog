<p>CAFE standards are stupid. I was reading in the WSJ that the government is renewing efforts to mandate these minimum mileage standards for cars. I am all for cars that get better mileage, or cars that don't use gas period. But, the government has no business mandating design on goods that they are not purchasing. If they are truly concerned, then what they should do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop subsidizing gas. Let it go up to $5/gallon and let the market decide what reasonable standards are for cars.</li>
<li>Fund alternative fuel research/contests.</li>
<li>Build a decent public transportation system (think Europe).</li>
</ol>
<p>Just my $0.02.</body></html></p>
