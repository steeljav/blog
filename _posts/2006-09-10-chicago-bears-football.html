<p>The Chicago Bears start the season today against Green Bay, in Green Bay. I'm not a huge football fan, but at the start of every season, I am hopeful that the Bears can do something. I remember the last time the Bears went to the superbowl. I was a kid, maybe 15 or so. It was great. I watched every game that season. I think everyone in Northern Illinois did. I doubt that the Bears will ever have a team like that again.</p>
