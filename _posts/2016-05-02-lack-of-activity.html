<p>If you follow this blog regularly, sorry about the lack of activity. It's been nice outside and I'm trying to catch up on yardwork before it gets miserable and the mosquitoes return.</p>
<p>Please check back because I'm working on two longer posts dealing with electrical safety and EAF phase balancing.</p>
