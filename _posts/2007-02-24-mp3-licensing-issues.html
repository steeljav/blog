<p>I found <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/function/0,,12215_pg_11,00.html?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf">this link</a> today. I'm not sure why this has not been posted to slashdot or digg or something similar yet. You can also read about it <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3661771">here</a>.</p>
<p>I don't understand why people don't use <a href="http://www.vorbis.com">Ogg</a> for all of their music encoding needs? It is free, open and a better encoding than mp3.</p>
