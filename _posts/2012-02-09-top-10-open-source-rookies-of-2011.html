<p>Came across <a href="http://www.blackducksoftware.com/news/releases/2011-01-07">this</a> while looking for something related. <a href="http://www.blackducksoftware.com/">Black Duck Software</a> apparently spent a lot of time looking at new open source projects and rated them on several factors to develop a top 10 list. The <a href="http://diasporaproject.org/">Diaspora Project</a> came in at #1, which is cool. I didn't recognize any of the other projects. This is the 4th year they have developed the top 10 rookies of the year.</p>
