<p>I finished reading The Catcher In The Rye last night. It is a pretty easy/fast read. A friend of mine actually read it on a Saturday once. It took all day, but he finished it.</p>
<p>I didn't get a lot out of it. I'm not sure why this novel is so popular among conspiracy theorists. There are some interesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher_in_the_rye">interpretations on wikipedia</a>. I guess they must look at the protagonist as an outsider and try to identify with him?</p>
<p>I don't get a lot of books though. I have read about four of Hemingway's books. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_Also_Rises">The Sun Also Rises</a> I felt like I could have written myself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls">For Whom The Bell Tolls</a> was ok. The last Hemingway book that I read was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Farewell_to_Arms">A Farewell To Arms</a> and I thought it was actually pretty good.</p>
