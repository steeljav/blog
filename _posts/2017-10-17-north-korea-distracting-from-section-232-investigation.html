<a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/355607-north-korea-is-distracting-from-americas-steel-import-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An article</a> by <a href="https://www.americansecurityproject.org/about/consensus/members/brigadier-general-john-adams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BG John Adams</a> discusses North Korean distractions from the ongoing Section 232 investigation. He covers all of the bases well. The thing that everyone seems to be missing though is that while we do have steel production, WE DON'T MANUFACTURE STEELMAKING EQUIPMENT IN THIS COUNTRY ANYMORE. At this point we are completely reliant on foreign companies (mainly European design manufactured all over the place) for everything from melting to casting to rolling.</body></html></p>
