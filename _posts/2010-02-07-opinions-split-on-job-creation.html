<p>There was an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703894304575047391420086772.html?mod=WSJ-economy-LEADStorySecond">article</a> in the weekend WSJ that indicated government job creation programs would not be enough. The chart at the bottom of the article graphically indicates the levels of the last 6 recessions and is very indicative of the depth of the hole we are in in terms of job losses. From the article: </p>
<p class="quote"> It would take more than seven years to regain the level of employment at the recession's start if jobs returned at the average rate at which they had been added in the previous expansion.</p>
<p>I can not see jobs returning at the rate they were added in the previous expansion. I think we are in for a long rough ride.</p>
