<p>Last night I tried to edit my blogs index.html directly. When I looked at the blog today all of my changes were gone. I didn't realize that you had to edit the template instead. And, you also need to rebuild the template after you save your edits to it before the changes will show up on your blog.</p>
<p>Editing the template is a pretty straightforward thing. There are some MT tags in there, but it is mostly just html with css.</p>
