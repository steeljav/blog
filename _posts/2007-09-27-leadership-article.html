<p>CNN Money has a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/10/01/100351829/index.htm?section=money_topstories">decent article</a> up about leadership and how top companies train and develop their future leaders. There is a short paragraph in the sidebar about military leadership and the special forces approach of training in teams at all times. I have always wondered why businesses that claim to want strong leaders don't look at the militaries approach to leadership development, considering that the military has developed some of the greatest leaders. But, being an ex Air Force guy, I am probably biased.</p>
