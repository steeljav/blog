<p>I finally got fed up with not being able to get a decent cup of coffee around home. I bought an espresso maker and bean grinder and started making coffee drinks. Espresso is ok, but I have really been enjoying cafe Americanos. I would say that it is most definitely better than any drip or French press coffee I have had. I have also made lattes, cafe au lait and a latte macchiato.</p>
