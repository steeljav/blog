<p>My wife and I went out for breakfast this morning to a place in Muscatine named <a href="http://local.google.com/local?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=la+morelia,+muscatine+iowa">La Morelia.</a> My wife had Huevos Rancheros and I had a couple Carnitas and a bowl of Menudo.  The tortillas are home made, and very good. I have been there for breakfast before with some colleagues from Monterrey Mexico. They have excellent food. If you are in the area, give it a try, I highly recommend it.</p>
