<p>I spent a few days in Cleveland Oh. last week at a seminar. This was the first time that I have been to cleveland. Cleveland seems like a pretty decent town. Traffic wasn't too bad, the people seemed nice, and I'm sure the cost of living is pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of the receptionist at the hotel, I tried some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi"> pierogi's</a> for supper. I have heard of them before, I think from some guys I new in the Air Force that were from either Ohio or upstate New York. So, they were ok. The ones that I had were just potato. I think that we will try to make some with other ingredients.</p>
