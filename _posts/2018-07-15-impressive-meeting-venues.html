<p>Found <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1rpNmNDgQN42">this</a> <a href="https://www.amanogroup.de/en/conference-events/amano-rooftop-conference/">place</a> while jogging in Berlin. If you are looking for an impressive place to hold a meeting, this might work. I've stayed in the area before and the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5k99vmaqpC22">neighborhood</a> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZxKcFmRxXv82">is</a> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/U5jjAVaL8Fr">excellent</a>. Plenty to see and do within a 10 minute walk, most of which is free.</p>
<p>I was thinking that there has to be companies that specialize in finding and organizing events in cool venues like this, but after searching around there doesn't seem to be. Maybe they exist but are so boutique and work with long term clients and so don't advertise much?</p>
