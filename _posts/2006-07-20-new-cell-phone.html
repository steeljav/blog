<p>I have been working with some German guys all week. They have these nice PDA cell phones from Germany. They are Tmobile MDA's, which is basically equivalent to a Verizon <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/01/04/verizon-makes-the-xv6700-official/">xv6700</a>. I need to get one of these. I <u>do not</u> want to get e-mail on my phone. If someone wants to get in touch with me, call the phone. I can't understand getting e-mail on a phone. But, I almost always have my laptop with me. The part of the phone that I really want is the calendar. It would make life easier for me. Coordinating things is starting to get difficult.</p>
<p>I have a 2 year contract with Verizon, so I need to stick with them. I have actually had really good luck with Verizon, and I am pretty happy with them.</p>
