<p>RPodder is a ruby script that I wrote for downloading podcasts. RPodder is meant to be used from the commandline, a cron job, batch job or scheduled task. Since it is written in Ruby, it can run on basically any platform. I am really surprised about this, but <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rpod">rpodder</a> is in the top 10% of downloads at <a href="http://rubyforge.org">rubyforge</a>. Also, I have received some additions that a guy made already. I was pretty surprised about that. He put in some of the features that I had planned to do in the future. Now I just need to find the time to review and merge his additions, test, and put up a new release. Hopefully I can do that this weekend. It will be tough due to homework for school that I need to get finished.</p>
<p>A friend tested rpodder on windows. As I expected, it worked just fine. I don't really have a windows machine to test on though, so you never know.</p>
