<p>I hate cubicles. One of the (many) reasons I left Lockheed Martin was because I worked in a windowless converted warehouse in a sea of hundreds of cubicles, and never saw the light of day.</p>
<p>Fortune has <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/09/magazines/fortune/cubicle_howiwork_fortune/index.htm">an article</a> detailing the history of the cubicle, from its idealistic roots to its current hideous guise. It is important to note that the cubicle was not designed as we know it today, it was mutated into its current state by economists and a perfect storm of events which are detailed in the article.</p>
