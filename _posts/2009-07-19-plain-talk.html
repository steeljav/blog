<p>Ken Iverson is considered to be the father of <a href="http://www.nucor.com">Nucor Steel</a>. Ken wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plain-Talk-Lessons-Business-Maverick/dp/0471155144/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1248040098&amp;sr=8-1">book</a> about business and leadership. New employees with Nucor are given this to read. I really enjoyed this book and read through it in about 2 days. It is a very easy read. I highly recommend it.</p>
