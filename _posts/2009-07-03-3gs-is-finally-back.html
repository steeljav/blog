<p>Wow, this website is finally back up. I had some technical issues and some personal things going on over the last couple of months. I decided to update my router firmware to the development branch and everything went to hell. I worked with it until I was able to get everything going again, with the exception of port forwarding to the web server. I read that other people were having the same weird issue with port forwarding to their web servers. I finally decided to pull the plug and go back to the stable branch.</p>
<p>So, more importantly, I accepted a new position with <a href="http://www.nucor.com">Nucor Steel</a> in Memphis. I started 2 weeks ago and am in the process of relocating to Memphis. I am really short on time right now so I can't say a lot, but I will soon.</p>
