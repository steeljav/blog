<p>I was just telling myself this morning that I need to do some work on the blog and I decided to ceck the stats. I was a little surprised. It looks like there are actually people (besides family and friends) that read this?</p>
<p>If you are a reader of this blog, what would you like to see? More tech stuff, more stuff about living in Iowa, more pictures? Leave some comments and let me know.</p>
