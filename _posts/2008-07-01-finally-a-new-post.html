<p>I have been meaning to put something on here for quite a while now but just have not had the time to do it.</p>
<p>I have been traveling as usual. I had the oportunity to spend 2 weeks at one of our shops in Brazil, very close to Rio. I was able to spend a few days checking out Rio while I was there. If you have never been to Rio, I highly recommend that you put it on your list of places to visit. I know many people (Brazilian and American) that do not like Rio. I do not understand why. Rio is one of the most beautiful places that I have ever been.</p>
<p>I drove out to one of our facilities in Oklahoma last week. I was pretty sick of flying/airports and flying around the 4th is always a pain in the ass. So, I rented a car and drove. I got a little messed up going into Tulsa, and it took about 10 hours total. On the way home I hauled ass and only stopped for gas. I made it home in about 8.5 hours.</p>
<p>Not doing much over the holiday. Staying home and relaxing. Planning to have family over and grill out.</p>
