<p>I am wore out. As some of you know I live in a 1918 bungalow and have been slowly updating it. We installed a 200A service and new main panel last year and have been re-wiring (slowly). The bedrooms and office are upstairs and only have 1 outlet in each room. I had an idea a few weeks ago about how to get power up to the second floor without going through the attic. I wasn't 100 percent sure that it would work, but after 2 full days of work I am positive it is going to work. I estimate I have about 5 more full days of work to complete this project but should have power connected by the end of today. I will post some pictures later.</p>
