<p>Good Pilot: </p>
<ol>
<li>USAF trained.</li>
<li>Was shot at in Vietnam, Iraq, etc.</li>
<li>Able to fly using primary instruments alone.</li>
<li>Deals with exceptional conditions well (ie. engine failure, avionics failures, landing gear problems, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Bad Pilot: </p>
<ol>
<li>Trained by 'Never Heard of It' University.</li>
<li>Looks like he/she can't be much over 20.</li>
<li>Not sure what primary instruments are.</li>
<li>Not sure what exceptional conditions are.</li>
</ol>
<p>Granted, being a USAF veteran, I am a little biased, but some of the airline pilots that I see really make me nervous.</p>
