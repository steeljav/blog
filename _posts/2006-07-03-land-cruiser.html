<p>The Toyota salesman called me tonight to let me know that he had a 99 land cruiser with 40K miles on it come in. That is a bummer, I would have checked it out. 40K miles on a Toyota is a joke. That thing should run like it is brand new. However, I am sure that it would not come cheap.</p>
<p>I have no regrets buying the land rover. In terms of off-road capability, I think it kicks the land cruisers ass. Just crawl under each of them and compare what you see. The land cruiser is a typical Toyota design. The land rover is built like a tank.</p>
