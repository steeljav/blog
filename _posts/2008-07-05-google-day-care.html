<p>There is an interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/05/business/05nocera.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">article</a> in the NY Times about how google screwed up on one of its big perks, on-site day care. You would think that with as much cash as google has, and some of the things that they have thrown money at they could make their day care perk a world benchmark.</p>
