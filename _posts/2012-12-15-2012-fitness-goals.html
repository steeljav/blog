<p>My fitness goals for 2012 changed a few times. Mainly because I started playing rugby last March. I feel like I have done well even though I changed goals. I have accomplished the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased strength on all lifts.</li>
<li>Increased squat to 325 Lbs.</li>
<li>Increased lean muscle mass by approximately 5 Lbs.</li>
<li>Increased knowledge of nutrient timing to optimize muscle growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately I also increased non-lean mass (AKA fat) while building muscle. I want to decrease bodyfat in order to increase my speed and do not want to lose the muscle I have worked hard building in the process. I am going to utilize a ketogenic diet to do this. I have used it in the past because it is muscle sparing. It is a difficult diet to maintain but works very well. I will post updates here occasionally but will update mainly on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/steeljav">twitter</a>. </body></html></p>
