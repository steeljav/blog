<p>In an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) reactance is generated by large currents (~60KA) in the secondary system. The currents generate large fields which result in mutual induction and coupling in the neighboring phases. To properly simulate the EAF, this phase to phase coupling needs to be accounted for. There have been numerous models throughout the years. I put together a Matlab simulation to generate a power curve for an EAF using various secondary reactance models just to get an idea of how the different models effect the results. This chart details this.</p>
