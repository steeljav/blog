<p>My goals for 2012 were simple, blog more and write a few technical papers. The year started out good in terms of blogging but I then ran out of time because I started playing rugby and my kids were in multiple sports. I wasn't able to meet my goal on technical papers, but did develop a very lengthy presentation for the AIST and gave a presentation to the Rockford Il. chapter of the IEEE. The presentations should count for something.</p>
<p>My goals for 2013 are simple as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog more than I have lately with an emphasis on steel production technology.</li>
<li>Research and write a few technical papers.</li>
<li>Achieve my fitness goals (to be determined).</li>
<li>Travel more.</li>
</ul>
