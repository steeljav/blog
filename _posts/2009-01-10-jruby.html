<p>I played around with JRuby for a few weeks and decided not to use it. My dilemna was that I wanted to use ruby for a project that I am working on. However, ruby does not have a cross platform 2D graphics package as part of its distribution. Java does but I prefer to use ruby. JRuby is an effort to combine the two, but I don't think that it is mature enough to base a long term project on. I will just suffer and use java.</p>
