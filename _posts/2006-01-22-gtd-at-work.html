<p>When I went back to work after Christmas/New Year's break, I decided that I should organize my office a little better. In the GTD book the author recommends that you have a file system that is within reach. I didn't have that. The consequence of not having a file system within reach was that I tended to not file everything. By that I mean that I would copy notes into my wiki and then through the notes away. </p>
<p>I decided that at a minimum I should have a folder for each project in my desk drawer. I found a metal file hanger and put it in the bottom drawer, and put a folder in for each project. It is working out well. If you are trying to use GTD I would suggest that you create a similar setup.</p>
