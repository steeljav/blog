<p>I spend most of the day listening to <a href="http://www.wbez.org">Chicago Public Radio</a> while I work. They mentioned a Time Magazine project that placed some of their writers in a house in Detroit for a year to research and write about the city. You can check it out <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1925681,00.html"> here</a>.</p>
