<p>I discovered <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook"> google notebook</a> by accident the other day. I didn't know that such a thing existed. After looking around on the internet a little it looks like it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook"> released in 2006</a>. Man, I am not keeping up.</p>
<p>It is pretty easy to use and also pretty handy. I have been using it as sort of a clipboard for links I find on the web. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/"> Lifehacker</a> has an <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/getting-things-done-with-google-notebook-256844.php"> article</a> that discusses how to set it up for use with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done"> GTD</a>.</p>
