<p>I was in Germany again last month and had an opportunity to get on the train and travel to where I lived when I was stationed at Spangdahlem AB. Things haven't changed much there. It's still what I would consider to be in the middle of nowhere, a 2 hour train ride or 1 hour drive from nothing spectacular. However, the food is still great, it's cheap and quiet. I was surprised to see new houses being built on the edge of town. I didn't think that happened there.</p>
