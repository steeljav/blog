<p>I am currently taking a DSP course. When I was in Minnesota I wanted to take a DSP course because of my interest in radio astronomy, ham radio, software defined radio etc. I really looked forward to taking this course. It has been absolutely horrible so far. The class and homework has been nothing but proofs and derivations. We have not implemented or simulated a signle filter yet, we are about halfway through the course. </p>
<p>When I was an undergraduate I had much more tolerance for the theoretical side of the topics. Now that I am in the real world working for a living, I just don't have the patience with the theoretical side of things that I used to. I just need to know practical information that I can use to get my job done. I am deffinitely not getting it in this course.</p>
