<p>If you are like me, you use google a lot. You may not be aware of some of the search modification operators that are available. One that I use frequently is the site operator. The site operator tells google to only return results from the specified domain. For example, I hate Major League Baseball's site but I want to get to the "official" Cubs site (GO CUBS!), to search mlb for the cubs you could use "cubs site:www.mlb.com" without the quotes. Or, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=cubs+site%3Awww.mlb.com&amp;btnG=Search"> here is a link to the search</a>. As I wanted, the link to the cubs page is at the top.</p>
<p>I find that the site operator comes in very handy when searching large websites for something that may not be so easy to find, or may no longer have a link from the main page, or maybe the sites built in search features are not very good. Here is a <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/help/refinesearch.html">link</a> to google's search operators. Enjoy.</p>
