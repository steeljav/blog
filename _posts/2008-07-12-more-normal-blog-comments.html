<p>I have started using <a href="http://www.haloscan.com"> Haloscan</a> for the comments on this blog. I use the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rublog/"> Rublog (Ruby Blog)</a> blog software. It is very very simple, and I really enjoy it for its simplicity. It works very well for me. The default approach for comments on Rublog is to e-mail your comment to the author who manually puts it into the blog if he/she wants. Very simple, but I think it turns some people off to commenting because it does not allow for anonymous comments. So check out the new comments setup and let me know if you have any problems with it.</p>
