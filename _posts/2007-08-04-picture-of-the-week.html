I used to think that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands">Badlands</a> was just a place in South Dakota, but it is actually a geological term used to describe this type of formation. There are actually other places in the world where this type of terrain exists, but I think that the Badlands in South Dakota are probably the largest. The park is much larger than I expected.</p>
