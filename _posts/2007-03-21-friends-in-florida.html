<p>I may be spending some time in Florida in the near future. I have some old friends that I thought might be living there, but I wasn't sure how to find them other than a white pages search, which usually doesn't turn up much. If you take the time to search through the county records that are all online now, it is absolutely amazing what you can find. Marriage licenses, home purcchases, home refinancing, building permits, traffic tickets, court documents, birth records. Hard to believe.</p>
<p>I assume that at some point google, yahoo or whoever will be good enough to spider these records, and it will be much, much easier to access this stuff. This may not be such a good thing.</p>
