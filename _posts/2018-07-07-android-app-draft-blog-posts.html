<p>I'm on planes a lot without internet access and sometimes want to start or work on a blog post. The WordPress app is great, but used to have issues with saving drafts locally (i.e. without internet access). Nice to see that has been resolved. The way that it works (for android anyway) is that your draft is saved to your phone. Unfortunately it is not automatically uploaded to your blog drafts when the phone is back online. You have to open each locally saved draft and resave it.</p>
<p>Not perfect, but at least it works.</p>
