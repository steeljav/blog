<p>I usually don't make goals for the year. For some reason I decided to do it this year. So, here are my goals for 2006:</p></p>
<h2>Profesional</h2>
<ol>
<li>Complete my Masters in Electrical Engineering. I should be done in May.</li>
<li>Achieve at least one consulting job.</li>
<li>Move on at least one of my ideas in the ideas notebook. More about this later.</li>
<li>Write and publish at least one paper.</li>
<li>Establish and/or develop as many professional contacts as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ol>
<li>Get a better handle on our cash flow.</li>
<li>Build up savings.</li>
<li>Re-wire our house.</li>
<li>Spend at least 1 hour/week studying markets and investing.</li>
<li>Incorporate some form of GTD at home.</li>
<li>Spend at least 10 minutes/day studying Spanish.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will note my progress on these goals as the year goes on.</p>
