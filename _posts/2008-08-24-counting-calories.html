<p>I have been dieting along with working out and jogging for about the last 3 months. I have found that I really need to watch calories if I want to lose weight. If you want to get a caloric count along with other nutritional information on about anything, <a href="http://www.calorie-count.com/"> this site</a> is pretty decent.</p>
