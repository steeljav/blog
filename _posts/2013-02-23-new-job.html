<p>I accepted a position with SGL Carbon and started a few weeks ago. My first few weeks have went very well. I am lucky to be working with some old colleagues again and all of my new colleagues have been great. The plan is that I will be working with customers on longer term process improvement projects. I expect that I will also have time for research and development of some of the ideas that I have had over the years.</p>
<p>I will not be consulting any longer. However, feel free to contact me if you require assistance with something. We (SGL) may be able to help.</p>
