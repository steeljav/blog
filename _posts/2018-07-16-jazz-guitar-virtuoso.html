<p>I've played guitar since I was 5 years old and am always looking for and finding new guitarists that impress me. I found John Scofield's a go go last month and was really impressed by it. I've listened to and known about Scofield for years, but never actually listened to any of his releases front to back. If your into jazz guitar, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen#/album//John+Scofield/A+Go+Go">check it out</a>.</p>
