<p>My wife was upset that I had never seen "Field of Dreams" so she bought it last week. I found out that the party we went to Saturday wasn't very far from Dyersville, which is where the field is at.</p>
<p>I thought that the movie was pretty good. Since the field isn't very far from here, I think that we are going to try to drive up there next weekend. I was thinking that it would probably be good to read the book though to get the real story. Everything gets changed and exagerated to make a movie. I am interested in what really happened there. I would also be interested to know when was the last time that anyone has seen long gone baseball players there. </p>
<p>I wanted to spend a few minutes writing about the pros and cons of life in Iowa. But, I think that I am going to wait until I have some more time and put it in its own post. In the last 12 years I have lived in Germany, Turkey, Denver, Phoenix, Chicago, the Twin Cities and now Iowa. And I have travelled from each of these areas. So, I feel like I have quite a bit to compare it to.</p>
