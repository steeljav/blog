<p>I got home from a trip to Cartersville Ga last night. I have decided that I am really sick of the Atlanta airport. It is too big, croweded, hot, and busy. From now on when I have to go to Cartersville, I am going to fly into Knoxville, rent a car and drive. It is only about a half hour longer from Knoxville. The Knoxville airport is small and a lot easier to get in and out of.</p>
