<p>I first started using the internet on a regular basis around 1995. I remember having this aha type moment one day when I finally realized how big of a deal the internet was going to be. One of the things that I really thought was amazing was how the net enabled a person to read newspapers online, from all over the world, any time of the day, for free. I drove about 700 miles this week, and for one reason or another started thinking about <a href="http://inkpot.com/news/"> this site</a>. I used to use it 10 years ago to find interesting newspapers from around the world to read. I am happy to see that the site is still up and running!</p>
