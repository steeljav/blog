<p>Sushi seems to be becoming more popular all the time in the US. I hear people that I work/travel with talk about eating sushi a lot. I spent a couple weeks in Texas last month working with a colleague. He eats sushi frequently in Florida. He is a serious advocate for sushi and wanted to have it for dinner. I have tried it a few times and have never been able to understand what the big deal is. I decided to go with him to give it a try, especially since he knew what he was doing with it. He said it was good sushi but I was still not impressed with it. I don't think I will try it again unless I go to Japan.</p>
