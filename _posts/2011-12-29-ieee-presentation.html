<p>I will be giving a presentation to the <a href="http://ieee.rackoneup.net/index.php">Rock River Valley IEEE Section</a> on EAF technology. I enjoy doing these, it is a great opportunity to meet other professionals and answer questions about steelmaking technology. It has been a while since I last presented, but it will be in May which is plenty of time. I don't think I have ever been given so much time to prepare.</p>
