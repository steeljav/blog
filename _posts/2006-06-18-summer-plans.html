<p>There are several things that I would like to do this summer. Unfortunately, I don't have many vacation days left already, so these will have to be weekend trips.</p>
<p>I want to go visit the <a href="http://www.fieldofdreamsmoviesite.com/distance.html">field of dreams</a>. I think that it is about an hour and a half from here or so. It is easily doable on a Saturday.</p>
<p>I want to go see basically all of the A league baseball teams around here, which would be the <a href="http://www.swingbaseball.com/">Swing</a>, the <a href="http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/app/index.jsp?sid=t420">Bees</a>, the <a href="http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/app/index.jsp?sid=t500">Lumber Kings</a> and the <a href="http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/app/clubs/ip_index.jsp?sid=milb&amp;cid=t492">Kernels</a>. I'm just not sure if my 4 yr. old can sit through a game.</p>
