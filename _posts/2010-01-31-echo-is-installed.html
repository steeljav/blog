<p>I was able to get <a href="http://js-kit.com">Echo</a> installed and running on my weblog. Click on the comments link for any post to try it out. I think it is pretty cool. Note that you can log in with your twitter credentials if you want. I will try to get the facebook connect features set up later today.</p>
