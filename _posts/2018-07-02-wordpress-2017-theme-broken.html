<p>Unfortunately the front page of this website is a little broken. The parallax feature that scrolls images and text isn't working anymore and you will only see the text unfortunately. Apparently the theme maintainers made an update at some point and it updates automatically and so broke. Hard to believe considering the number of blogs that probably use this feature. I was advised to find a new theme. Kind of a bummer because I really liked this theme and it fits my needs well and I don't really have the time to work on a website.</p>
