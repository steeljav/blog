<p>I remember the last time the Bears were in the superbowl. I was about 13 or so. I think that I watched every game that season, as did everyone I knew. It is pretty awesome to have the Bears in the superbowl again. we are not doing anything special for the game. Just sitting around with the kids, eating junk food and watching the game. I think that this weekend would be a great weekend to spend in the city.</p></p>
