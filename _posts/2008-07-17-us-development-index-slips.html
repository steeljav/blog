<p>I came across <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7511426.stm">this article</a> today at the <a href="http://bbc.co.uk"> bbc</a>. According to the report, Americans live shorter lives than citizens of almost every other developed nation. From the article: </p>
<p class="quote">
<ul>
<li>Of the world's richest nations, the US has the most children (15%) living in poverty.</li>
<li>Of the OECD nations, the US has the most people in prison - as a percentage and in absolute numbers.</li>
<li>25% of 15-year-old students performed at or below the lowest level in an international maths test - worse than Canada, France, Germany and Japan.</li>
<li>If the US infant mortality rate were equal to first-ranked Sweden, more than 20,000 babies would survive beyond their first year of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eye opening stuff. The interesting thing for me is that I didn't find any articles at CNN or the New York Times about this report.</p>
