<p>Things are going pretty well for me in Memphis. I am becoming less and less useless every day at work. I have a lot to do, and deffinitely a long way to go, but I should start making progress in the very near future.</p>
<p>I like the Memphis area. The food is excellent, you could really put some weight on here between <a href="http://www.gussofms.com">Gus's Fried Chicken</a> (probably the best I have ever had), <a href="http://www.corkysbbq.com"> Corky's BBQ</a>, <a href="http://www.interstatebarbecue.com">Interstate BBQ</a> and all of the other great places to eat here. The traffic here is not as bad as people make it out to be.</p>
<p>After work Friday I went jogging along the river <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=tom+lee+park+memphis+tn&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;gl=us&amp;cid=5634936840527738090&amp;li=lmd&amp;ll=35.136686,-90.063729&amp;spn=0.007756,0.010879&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">here</a>. It was really nice out, sunny, not too hot, and a nice breeze off of the river. The river current is very strong down here, It is visibly strong.</p>
<p>Still unsure about what area to live in. I am considering Hernando Ms, and Collierville/Germantown Tn. This weekend has been beautiful, but I have been lazy and not gotten out much.</p>
<p>Our house in Iowa went on the market yesterday. I will really miss the house. Between working on a Masters Degree and then traveling for work I didn't have the time to do everything I wanted to it, but we did make a lot of nice improvements over the 6 years that we lived there. Someone is going to get a really nice 1918 bungalow in a great location that does not need much.</p>
