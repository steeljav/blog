<p>I wanted to watch a DVD on my windoze laptop. I put it in, and some 3rd party piece of shit player opened up, and then choked and died. It gave a bullshit generic error message and that was it.</p>
<p>I tried to watch it with Windoze media player also. MediaPlayer can't play DVD's I guess. It claimed that there was nothing in the drive.</p>
<p>Very Gay. I really don't have the time to fix it. Also, if I were going to take the time to work on it, I would make it work on one of the Linux boxes via DeCSS.</p>
