<p>I need to get packed up today. I think that I remembered about everything I needed to take from work. I did forget to set an out of the office message in outlook. Oh well. I am looking forward to this trip. I think that it will be a very good week. I will get to work on one thing for a week. I can't remember the last time that I got to work on one thing for a day. I am usually trying to juggle several things while sidestepping numerous interuptions.</p>
