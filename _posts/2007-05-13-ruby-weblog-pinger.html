<p>I put together a short <a href="http://www.billybryant.net/ping_trackers"> ruby script</a> that will send weblog update pings to feedburner, bloglines and technorati. Since I use a <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rublog/"> barebones ruby based weblog</a>, the pinging functionality is not built as it is with many of the more full featured (bloated) weblog environments. If you need to use this, just insert your weblog name and address where indicated, and run it when you update your blog.</p>
