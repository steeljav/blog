<p>When I was a kid growing up in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=rock+falls+illinois">Rock Falls Illinois</a> I remember a few winters where it got so cold that they closed the steel mill (Northwestern Steel and Wire) where my dad worked and sent everyone home. There aren't many things that will close a steel mill down. I seem to recall -70F wind chills to be one of them.  We haven't shut our mill down yet. I don't think that they have ever shut this mill down for inclement weather.  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2006/02/damn_cold.png" alt="cold_pic"></p>
