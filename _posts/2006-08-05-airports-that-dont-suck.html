<p>Why don't these airports suck? They provide <u><b>FREE WIRELESS INTERENT!!</b></u></p>
<p>Note that Tampa has made my list. I was in Tampa last week for a few days.</p>
<p>I have written about this before. I can not understand the motivation of an airport to not offer free wireless internet. Most of the airports that I go to have wireless, but they charge around $10/day to access it. They can not be making that much money off of it. They should just provide it for free and spread out a $0.05 charge to everyone using the airport.</p>
