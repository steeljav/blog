<p>I was hoping that I would be able to finish up what I had to do in Jersey, but I couldn't get the job done. I will have to go back. I have to navigate <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=woodbridge+new+jersey&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.540287,-74.295688&amp;spn=0.014546,0.037293&amp;om=1">this</a> crazy interchange when I go out there. I'm not sure how they came up with this crazy design.</p>
