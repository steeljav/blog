<p>I have been hitting the weights reasonably hard since finishing the rugby season. I have managed to gain 7 Lbs of muscle but haven't decreased my bodyfat percentage much even though I have been jogging. I was throwing some numbers around and if I were able to increase my bench press by ~4 Lbs/week I would be able to bench 300 by the end of the year. It doesn't sound too tough, but I think that is probably a lot to gain weekly over a 6 month span. I have always had a hard time building chest muscle for some reason.</p>
