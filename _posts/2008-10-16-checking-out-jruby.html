<p>I am playing around with <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/"> Jruby</a>. It is an implementation of the Ruby programming langauge for the java virtual machine. I really like Ruby, I would use it for everything, but it does not have a multi-platform graphics library built in to it. Java does, so it is a way to have both.</p>
