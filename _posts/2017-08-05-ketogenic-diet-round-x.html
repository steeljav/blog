<p>I resumed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ketogenic diet</a>Â last month because I started having issues with carb crashes and brain fog again. The last time I tried the diet I gave up after approximately 3 weeks due to lethargy and weakness. I hit the 3 week mark at the beginning of this week and encountered the same symptoms. There is an excellent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subreddit on keto dieting</a> and several people noted that this was normal (even after 3 weeks) and usually due to lack of fluid and electrolyte management. I found that after increasing fluid and electrolyte intake I felt much better. I'm now enjoying the cognitive benefits and constant energy levels this diet is known to provide.</p>
