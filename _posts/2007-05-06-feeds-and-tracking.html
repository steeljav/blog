<p>I have added some of the customary blog feed "chicklets" and technorati features to the bottom of the sidebar. The feedburner stuff seems to slow down loading a bit. If it is really noticeable let me know, and I will remove it.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked out feedburner or technorati, you should check them out. They offer some nice services for free.</p>
