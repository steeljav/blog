<p>The DSP class just went from bad to worse. We had our first exam and I did not do very well, although I am not concerned about it because I am there to learn and not get a grade. Kind of a strange position, but I really don't care about the grade, I am just there to learn about how to design digital filters. Unfortunately, our instructor has elected to skip over the 2 design chapters that are in the book. I guess he believes the theory is more important. Whatever.</p>
<p>When I took courses at the U of Mn for a MS in Software Engineering, the majority of the instructors I had were highly experienced practicing/retired professionals from the software field. The classes were excellent. I would estimate about 100% practical information. Unfortunately, my MSEE classes at the U of Iowa are nothing like that.</p>
