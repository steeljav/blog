<p>If you have been here before, you probably noticed that things look a little different. I noted a while back that I was going to change the blog theme and am finally getting around to it. Please bear with me.</p>
<p>I like the extremely simple, clean look of most blogs today. Obviously most of the world accesses the web through mobile devices and producing simple clean pages makes for a much better mobile experience.</p>
<p>I have been posting a lot more to my <a href="https://plus.google.com/+billybryant" target="_blank">google+ page</a>. Please check it out. My plan is to continue to publish the more complicated technical things with mathematics and graphics here because I can utilize the excellent <a href="http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/" target="_blank">QuickLaTeX plugin</a>.</p>
<p>I added a google+ badge to the sidebar and so if you have javascript blocking enabled in your browser it won't show up, or you may get a security warning or something. I'm not tracking anything, it's just trying to load my google+ info.</p>
<p>Feedback is always welcome.</p>
