<p>I set up a <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rpod">project page</a> for the rpodder script at RubyForge. You can download the newsest version of it from there. The script seems to be working. I have used it to download podcasts from several different sources successfully. It blows my mind that I can get so much functionality with a little over 100 lines of ruby!</p>
