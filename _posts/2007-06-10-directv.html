<p>We finally took the plunge, cancelled our cable service and got directv. We have been considering it for quite a while, but just never moved on it. We had a little bit of a problem with a storm last week where we lost the signal for 10 or 15 minutes. Other than that it has worked as advertised.</p>
<p>We did a lot of blog searches to see if anyone had complaints before we signed up. We really couldn't find any complaints, and we don't have any to add.</p>
