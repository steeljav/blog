<p>Had a problem at work last night. A piece of equipment failed on us and we have been down since. We are having the part that we need hand delivered tonight from Texas. I have to go in at 0300 to get things going again. Sometimes it is good to be valued, other times it sucks. </p>
<p>One thing that I realized again today is the vital importance of questioning authority and the status quo. We should have had this part as a spare. I just assumed there was a reason that we didn't, and accepted things for the way they are. That is a bad thing to do, but it is very easy to do also. I do it without even thinking about it.</p>
