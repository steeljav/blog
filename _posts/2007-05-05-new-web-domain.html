<p>I finally got around to calling my isp and asking for a static IP address. Since I have a static IP, I went ahead and licensed the domain billybryant.net. If you go to http://www.billybryant.net it should bring you to the same place. I will keep the other address for a while so that nobody's links/bookmarks get broken. At some point, I will set up permanent redirection from bbryant.dnsalias.net to the new domain.</p>
<p>You don't have to do it today, but if you have links or bookmarks for this site you should think about changing them to the new address http://www.billybryant.net. Also, I just updated my server, and it looks like the Debian package managers did some weird stuff with Apache (the web server). If you have any problems with the site, let me know.</p>
