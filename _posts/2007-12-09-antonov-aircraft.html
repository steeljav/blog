<p>Electric arc furnace transformers are large and quite heavy. Generally they are shipped via boat and rail. But I have heard stories about times when one absolutely had to get there over-night (or close to it). In those cases about the only commercial aircraft that could carry one was an Antonov. <a href="http://www.vectorsite.net/avantgt.html">Here</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225">are</a> <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=antonov&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=images&amp;ct=title">some</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvynLgMEn8I">links</a>.</p>
