<p>I don't watch a lot of TV, but I am a pretty big fan of 24. I have watched just about every episode since season 2. I missed season 1 for some reason that I can't remember, but I was given the DVD's of it for Christmas. So I started watching them the other day. Without commercials, you can watch an episode in about 35 minutes. It is pretty cool.</p>
<p>I am on about episode 7 right now, and it is starting to get better. If I would have watched the first few episodes the first season, I don't think I would have watched much more after that. It was pretty slow. Quite a bit different than what it is now.</p>
<p>I just keep wondering how many more times Jack Bauer can save the world. He has to be tied with Bruce Willis by now. Also, who in the hell would want to work for CTU? That place sucks. You couldn't pay me enough to work there.</p>
