<p>Looks like the weather in Iowa is going to be really decent in terms of temp's this weekend. However, it is going to rain. I was hoping to take a spin up to Dyersville to the <a href="http://www.leftandcenterfod.com/html/index_return.html"> field of dreams</a>, or go to the <a href="http://www.iowadnr.com/parks/state_park_list/maquoketa_caves.html"> Maquoketa Caves State Park</a> which is right down the road. Looks like we will need to find something else to do. Maybe it is a good weekend to just hang out around the house and take it easy?</p>
