<p>Going home tonight. Not looking forward to trying to make it through Houston/Bush airport. It is another example of an airport that is not big enough for the amount of people that are being pushed through it.</p>
<p>The last time I was there, I had a few hours to kill. I was doing some work and this guy sat next to me with one of the bluetooth phones on. This clown sat there talking about his life with someone like there was nobody around. Creepy.</p>
