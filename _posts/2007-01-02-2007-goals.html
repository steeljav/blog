<p>The goals that I have for 2007 are even simpler than last year because I am trying to be realistic and I can't think of much. I may add a few more later.</p>
<p><b><u>Personal Goals</u></b> </p>
<ol>
<li>Bench press 300 lbs. and get squat back up above 300 lbs.</li>
<li>Continue saving and studying market and investment strategies.</li>
<li>Start playing guitar again. Although I'm not sure how this is possible with my travel schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><u>Professional Goals</u></b> </p>
<ol>
<li>Continue to make as many professional contacts as possible.</li>
<li>Learn more about metallurgy.</li>
</ol>
