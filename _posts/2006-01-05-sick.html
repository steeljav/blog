<p>There is a flu going around, and somehow, I managed to catch it. I tried to go to work Wed. morning. I made it through about an hour then started feeling nauseated and had to split. Stayed home again today. I hate missing work because of being sick. Skip work to go to a Cubs game, no sweat, but missing work to stay home sick really sucks. I will go back tomorrow. Hopefully this flu bug goes away.</p>
