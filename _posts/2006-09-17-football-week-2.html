<p>The Bears made Detroit look silly this week. Unfortunately, if I would have betted the way that I wanted on this game (-110 32u), I would have lost. I didn't think that there would be much offense at all considering the strengths of both teams defense. I was basing the Detroit defense on last weeks game with Seattle. The one thing that I didn't research was the possibility that Seattle's offense sucks.</p>
<p>Additionally, U of Iowa beat ISU Saturday, coming from behind to get it done. If I had bet on that one, I would have done the moneyline bet on Iowa, and I would have won this one.</p>
