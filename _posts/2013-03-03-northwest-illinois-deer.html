<p>Took my 7 year old out hiking in the woods yesterday. There is snow on the ground now and we did not see a single set of deer tracks. I didn't bow hunt this year because I didn't see any deer prior to the start of or during hunting season. Most of the guys I know that did go out said that they saw more coyotes than deer. I have heard that the severe drought has caused a lot of sickness in the population and also caused them to migrate out of the area.</p>
