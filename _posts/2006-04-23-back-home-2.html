<p>I went to Cartersville Georgia and Knoxville Tennessee last week for work. We have facilities in both places. They were both nice places. Cartersville is up in the hills of Northern Georgia. Knoxville is surrounded by hills in Tennessee. </p>
<p>The knoxville facility is looking for an electrical engineer. I don't think I would move to either place though. I am really content living where we are at in Iowa. There are many places that have more to offer in one way or another, but I think when you look at the balance of everything, Iowa is a great place to live.</p>
