<p>I've played guitar most of my life but never heard of <a href="http://www.trainwreck.com/" target="_blank">TrainWreck Amplifiers</a>. They are some of the most sought after amps today and go for upwards of $30,000 if you can find one. There is a good playthrough of several of these on <a href="https://youtu.be/1HIbgtOJjbg" target="_blank">youtube</a>.</p>
<p>These amps are noted for being very touch sensitive with immediate response. From an engineering standpoint this implies that the time constant of the overall circuit is small. One of the first things I noticed about my Mesa Mark 5 was that the response was much more immediate than what I was used to. It is a double edged sword: it either allows you to demonstrate your virtuosity very clearly, or it conveys mistakes you never knew you made.</p>
