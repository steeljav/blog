<p>I'm transitioning my website from a self hosted wordpress site to a wordpress.com site. I've used wordpress for years now and want to support development. I also want to save time by not having to manage the wordpress updates and SSL certs myself. Wordpress.com covers both of those. Please bare with me during the transition.</p>
