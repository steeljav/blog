<a href="http://upverter.com">This</a> is kind of cool. A way to do schematic layout on-line. It crashed on me while I was trying to lay something out, but it is still in early start-up and looks to be nice once it is developed.</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://upverter.com/ourstory/">"our story" link</a> mentions that there are few amateur/open hardware projects out there compared to software. They are correct that a lack of free or low-cost design and simulation tools is a barrier to entry. But I think the larger barrier is availability of instrumentation for prototyping and building hardware. Not many people can afford an oscilloscope, function generator, multi-meter, etc.<br />
