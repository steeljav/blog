<p>A few weeks ago when the tornadoes hit Alabama, I just happened to be flying home from Jacksonville. The flight from JAX to Chicago was about 4 hours late. When it finally got to JAX, the people getting off looked pretty shook up. One passenger was sick and had to be taken off of the aircraft in a wheelchair. I didn't think much of it, but the flight through all of the bad weather turned out to be one of the roughest rides I have ever been on. It was turbulent to the point that I was concerned about the integrity of the airframe. Not a fun ride.</p>
<p>Last week when I was flying home from Houston it was sort of the same deal. A lot of turbulence. It must be that time of the year.</p>
