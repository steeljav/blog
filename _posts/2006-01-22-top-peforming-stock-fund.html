<p>One of my 2006 goals was to spend at least 1hr/week studying the market and investing. I subscribe to Money magazine, and I usually read it (last semester was an exception). This months issue had a year end review of the top funds. The top fund, the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SSGRX">"BlackRock Global Resources Inv. A (SSGRX)"</a> had a 61.1% return for 2005, 56.1% return over the last 3 years and a 36.2% return over the last 5 years. Very impressive. It would be interesting to know what techniques the fund manager(s) use to be so successful.</p>
