<p>I changed the spark plugs in the rover today. It was one of the easiest plug changes I have done. Unfortunately, the #7 plug was cross-threaded when it was installed. I could feel it starting to tighten when I was taking it out, so I stopped and put it back in. </p>
<p>Not sure what to do about it. The options are to have the head tapped and put a coil on the plug, or change the head, or just leave it. I plan on having this vehicle for a while, so I can't just leave it. Changing the head looks like quite a job on this motor, so I don't really want to do that either. So, looks like I need to get set up to tap the head and coil the plug. Kind of a bummer, but it happens.</p>
