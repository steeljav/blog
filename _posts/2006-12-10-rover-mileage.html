<p>I have updated the Land Rover Mileage spreadsheet that is on Google spreadsheets. You should be able to see it <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pclBh8cJ512x1f148fVlHQg">here</a>.</p>
<p>I made some mistakes on it earlier and screwed it up, and so now it only goes back to September. Looks like I am getting around 15 MPG, mostly on 89 octane gas.</p>
