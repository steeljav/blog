<p>The BBC has an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8411408.stm">article</a> up that briefly covers gold mining in Peru. National Geographic devoted most of an issue to the topic this year, part of it is <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/1">here</a>. It is difficult to grasp the magnitude of damage being caused by deforestation for gold extraction until you see some of the pictures of what is left behind. Additionaly this says nothing for the tons of Mercury that are dumped in the process.</p>
