<a href="http://dw.com/en" target="_blank">DW</a> posted <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/what-germanys-eating-these-days/g-18975899" target="_blank">this</a> to twitter. Interesting that they didn't list Turkish food as a favorite. Kebab shops are everywhere, the food is excellent, fast, reasonably healthy and cheap.</body></html></p>
