<p>We watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343737/">The Good Shepherd</a> last night. I am very interested in the cold war era, espionage, military operations, etc. but this was a long movie without much action, even for me. The movie details the messed up life of one of the founders of the CIA, played by Matt Damon. It was directed by DeNero, who makes a few appearances. I was surprised to see that Joe Pesci makes a short appearance also.</p>
<p>On a 1-5 scale (1 = avoid it, 5 = buy it), if you are into cold war history, espionage, etc. I would give it a 3. If you are not into cold war history, espionage, etc. I would give it a 1.</p>
