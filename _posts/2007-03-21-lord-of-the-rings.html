<p>My 5 year old son like to be read to. I have been reading to him before he goes to bed for about 3 years or so now. About a year ago I decided to try to start reading him "The Hobbit". I didn't think that he would be able to stay focused on it, and I had some doubts about finishing it. His attention span is pretty short. So, I found a copy of the book that is large, and has illustrations, some pretty cool artwork.</p>
<p>We finished The Hobbit in a few months, and so I decided to start reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy to him. We are about halfway through The Fellowship of the Ring, which is the first book in the trilogy. I read all of these books when I was in high school and I forgot how good they are.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings is that JRR Tolkein wrote them to read to his children. So, if you need a good book to read to your kids, start with The Hobbit.</p>
