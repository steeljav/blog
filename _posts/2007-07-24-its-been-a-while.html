<p>Well, I thought that I would get a few posts up a few weeks ago, but it didn't happen. I have been very busy, and of course traveling.</p>
<p>I went to Brazil again for about 2 weeks. It was a really nice trip. I spent about 5 days in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=curitiba,+brazil&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-25.420951,-49.273682&amp;spn=37.112058,51.064453&amp;z=4&amp;om=1">Curitiba</a> which is in the state of Parana. It is a very, very nice town, and I am convinced that I could be content with living there. Unfortunately I forgot my camera cable, and so I only have a couple pictures from my colleagues phone to put up. I was able to go to another soccer game, which was awesome, and of course ate a lot of really good food. There are some outstanding restaurants in Curitiba.</p>
<p>I also spent 5 days on the outskirts of Sao Paulo. It was a nice trip. Very short, but nice. I would really like to spend a few years in Brazil. I think it would be a great experience.</p>
