<p>Looks like I am going to Mexico again. I will probably be down there about a week this time. This will be my 3rd time in Monterrey. We usually stay at the Presidente' hotel. It is very nice. I don't feel like I have taken enough pictures when I have been down there the last 2 times, so I will try to rectify that on this trip. If things work out, we may be able to catch a soccer match. That would be so excellent.</p>
<p>Thinking about eating tortas and tacos is making me hungry already.</p>
