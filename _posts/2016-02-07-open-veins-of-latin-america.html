I don't want to write a thesis about it because I'm sure that many others much more knowledgeable than myself have already done so. It is an excellent starting point if you have an interest in Latin American history. It was published in 1970. Based on my visits I would say that life in Latin America has improved considerably since then.</body></html></p>
