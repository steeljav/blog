<p>Wired has a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.05/st_coolwhip.html">short article</a> this month about what goes into Cool Whip. Lately I have been considering buying some land in the country so that we can raise our own beef, pork, chickens and vegetables. When I read ingredient labels it isn't the fat, salt or calories that worry me, it is the stuff that I can not pronounce. I think that Wired's Cool Whip breakdown is fairly indicative.</p>
