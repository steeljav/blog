<p>NASA chose my ex-employer Lockheed Martin to build the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/09/01/business/20060901_NASA_GRAPHIC.html">next generation space vehicle</a>. This will be the first space vehicle that Lockheed has built, unless you count the SR-71.</p>
<p>I heard one of the talking heads at NASA bragging about Lockheed choosing to build on proven technology vs. Northrop and Boeing wanting to do something revolutionary. I have always said that Lockheed doesn't do much inovation. They just try to put old wine in a new bottle. Additionally, my experience with working for Lockheed was that they are very good at winning contracts, but then they sub-contract most of it out and act as a general contractor (ie. systems integrator).</p>
