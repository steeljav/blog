<p>The copyright to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream">"I Have a Dream"</a> speech and its live performance are owned by a consortium that is ran by Sony. If you want to "legally" watch it in its entirety you have to buy the DVD for $20. Hard to believe: <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Motherboard/~3/YLrDUXwScwI/copyright-king-why-the-i-have-a-dream-speech-still-isn-t-free">link</a>.</p>
