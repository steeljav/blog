<p>I have been trying to make progress on some java software development lately and not spending much time trolling the internet for interesting things to post here.</p>
<p>We provided a tour of SSC to the NIU IEEE Student Group yesterday morning. It went very well, they were all impressed with the steelmaking process and had some good questions. I was very surprised at the turnout for 0900 on a Saturday morning. As always I made a pitch for considering an Engineering career in steel.</p>
<p>I'm diligently working on Engineering for the replacement of metering, protection and control of our main distribution substation. It is all analog electro-mechanical Westinghouse equipment that is being replaced with SEL digital components. Our documentation is dated (~1950's) and not the best which makes the job harder than it normally would be. I end up doing more reverse engineering than forward engineering.</p>
<p>Looking forward to spring....</p>
