<p>It is a really nice morning. It is 70 degrees, a little hazy and the sun is coming up. If I were self employed and worked from home I would sit outside on the back porch and work.</p>
<p>I just read an article in Money magazine that described how a few people became self employed and how they enjoy the freedom it gives them. No kidding, why else do people become self employed? Freedom and the chance to make more money than any employer would ever give.</p>
