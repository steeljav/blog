<p>I have used an older version of <a href="http://js-kit.com">JSKit</a> for commenting functionality on this weblog and it has worked out great. Unfortunately I received an e-mail the other day explaining that the older version I have been using (for free) will be going away. So, my options are to pay the $12/Yr (very reasonable) for the upgrade to the newer version of JSKit, hack something together myself for simple comment functionality, get some new blog software or move to one of the blogging services. Not sure what I am going to do at this point.</p>
