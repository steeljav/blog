<p>It took my 4 yr. old about 5 minutes to figure out how to rent a movie on the hotel TV. I can't believe it. He can't read a single word of the instructions, but he figured out how to find the movie Hedgehog and rent it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how he figures these things out. But, he does the same thing with his PS2. He gets in to the options and figures out how to do things via the sequence, and then remembers it. Wild.</p>
