<p>I am home on vacation over the holidays. I usually rent a lot of movies when I am home over the holidays. Here is what I have watched this year: </p>
<ul>
<li>Miami Vice - The best part of this movie was when it ended. It was absolutely terrible. Save your cash.</li>
<li>Spy Games - I have seen this before, but it is a pretty cool movie, even if Brad Pitt is in it.</li>
<li>Syriana - This was interesting. I'm not sure how accurate or realistic it is. It was worth $2.00</li>
<li>Munich - This movie was ok. The really weird thing about it was that it was like watching a movie made in the 70's. You really can not tell that it is a new movie. It was worth $2.00 also.</li>
<li>Thank You For Smoking - This movie was pretty funny. It was worth $2.00.</li>
<li>The Sum of All Fears - This was pretty decent. It would have been better if Morgan Freedman had been in it a little longer.</li>
</ul>
