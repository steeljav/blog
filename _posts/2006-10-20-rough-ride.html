<p>Went out to Oklahoma again last week. As always, it was a good trip. I like the Tulsa area. Not too bigh, not too small, not crowded, not busy. The plane ride to Memphis from Moline was very rough. The plane ride home from Memphis to Moline was even rougher. I don't know what the deal was. Lots and lots of serious turbulance.</p>
<p>Found a bunch of Mexican restaurants close to where I usually stay when I go out there. From now on when I go out there, I will probably eat Mexican every night. I love Mexican food.</p>
