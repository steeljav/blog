<p>Read an <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21541711">interesting article</a> in <a href="http://www.economist.com">The Economist</a> last night about a would be pirate in the 16th century, Anthony Knivet. Knivet was captured by the Portuguese who spared his life by making him a sugar plantation slave. Brazilian sugar plantations in the 16th century were notoriously harsh and the life expectancy of a plantation slave was very low. Mr. Knivet allegedly escaped multiple times and was either re-captured or traded back into slavery by natives. In one escape he made it all the way across the Atlantic to Portuguese Angola before being re-captured and returned to Brazil.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe that Knivet was never killed and that he actually made it back to England eventually. An interesting read if you have 10 minutes to spare.</p>
