<p>I'm not sure why, but I have really been missing Europe lately. I lived right outside of Bitburg Germany for 3 years while I was in the Air Force. It was really an interesting time in my life. But after about a year of being there I was very ready to leave and come back to the US. After 3 years, I was so fed up with the place that I didn't think I would ever come back. Lately I have been thinking that the problem was that I wasn't mature enough to appreciate Europe. I think that if I were to expatriate to Germany, or the Netherlands, or France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria or Switzerland I could be very happy there. I think that I would probably want to be about where I was at before, which was a very central location. A few hours from Paris, Amsterdam, Switzerland. A few minutes from Luxembourg and maybe an hour from Belgium.</p>
<p>When the BSE group was here last summer they said that they were looking for Electrical Engineers with melt shop experience. I would love to go work with those guys and live in Southern Germany where they are at, but I can't get the wife to buy in. Looks like I am stuck in Iowa.</p>
