<p>I have had 2 13" MacBook Pros in the last 10 years. They have both been good laptops and I have had very little, if any, complaints. The last 13" was getting old and I really needed more screen space. The new MB Pros haven't had the best reviews, but I really couldn't wait another year so I bought one.</p>
<p>I have very little bad to say about the new 15" MB Pro and really can't understand all of the bad reviews and complaints. Some of the Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard: the new keyboard has keys that travel very little and are very poppy. I have heard a LOT of people complain about it. I type A LOT and I really like it.</li>
<li>Touch Bar: Probably the most complained about new feature. Typically referred to as a gimmick. I actually like it and expect that it will improve tremendously over time.</li>
<li>Display: The new display is phenomenal. Very crisp, beautiful picture.</li>
<li>Larger trackpad: This is a real improvement over the previous smaller trackpad.</li>
<li>Sound: I could barely hear sound from the speaker(s?) on my last 13". The sound has improved majorly and has plenty of volume.</li>
<li>Battery Life: I haven't done anything to measure this technically, but my experience has been that it goes all day on a charge doing development work, web browsing, streaming music, etc. No complaints.</li>
<li>Weight: It's about the same as my 13" was. Very portable and won't kill your shoulder from carrying it through airports all day.</li>
<li>Performance: Excellent. I have several heavy apps running at the same time without so much as a hiccup.</li>
<li>Color: I got the new space gray and think it looks awesome.</li>
<li>Fingerprint reader: After doing an initial logon you can use the fingerprint reader at the side of the bar to log in. Not that typing a password is a big deal, but it is convenient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few very small cons with 1 exception:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 exception: The apple logo in the lid doesn't light up anymore. This is not cool. It might be crossing a line.</li>
<li>The USB-C charger is not magsafe. But none of the dozen or so windoze laptops I've had ever were either and I never destroyed one because of it. I thought the mag connector was a nice feature, but no major loss.</li>
<li>The escape key on the touch bar is a little awkward to hit at times. I use the VI editor a lot and so I hit the escape key a lot. Probably not an issue for normal people.</li>
<li>There is a key for siri in the touch bar and it's right above the delete key. I tend to over-reach and wake siri up every few hours.</li>
</ul>
