<p>There are eagles out everywhere in Eastern Iowa right now. I have never seen an eagle in my life until this year. I was out shoveling the snow during new years week and saw one gliding on the wind a few hundred feet up. Last weekend we wanted to take the kids down by the river and look for them. As we were getting into the vehicle an eagle jetted over us at about 30 feet. We went to lock and dam 16 and there were a lot of eagles flying along the river and hanging out in the trees. I have some pictures that I will put up later when I have more time.</p>
