<p>I am almost finished with 6 weeks of ketogenic dieting. I have lost 8.8 Lbs, some of which is water and unfortunately some is probably muscle. I have lost strength which I knew would happen based on past experience. Every ketogenic dieting book I have read claims that the strength will come back, but this doesn't seem to be the case for me. I am convinced that you have to have carbohydrate to to build, or at least maintain muscle.</p>
<p>I am planning to continue this diet for at least a few more weeks. I would like to lose another 10 Lbs, but am not sure how feasible that is. The one thing I really like about this diet is that once you establish ketosis you have constant energy throughout the day (at least I do). Another thing that I have noticed is that my brain seems to work better, it's hard to explain but I feel smarter. I have read about other people having the same experience and it is due to the brain utilizing ketones as fuel instead of glucose.</p>
