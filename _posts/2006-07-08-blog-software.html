<p>I am still looking around for blog software. I just can't seem to find what I want. I want something simple, preferably written in Ruby. It needs to be able to use a flat file database, or something simple like <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a>. I don't need css support. I don't need preview, although it is ok. I don't need trackbacks, file upload, template support etc.... I do need comments. I don't need a web based config utility. Search can be accomplished by using google.</p>
<p>I am starting to think that the only way I am going to get what I want is to roll my own. I just don't have the time to do it right now.</p>
