<a href="https://www.aist.org/local-member-chapters/find-a-chapter/globe-trotters/annual-meeting-(1)">Globetrotters</a> is coming up in a few weeks. Unfortunately I won't be attending this year due to time constraints. I always get a lot out of the meeting and highly recommend it to anyone considering attending.</body></html></p>
