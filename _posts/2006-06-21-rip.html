<p>Well, it appears that my trusty red 1997 Cavalier has finally kicked the bucket for good. It has been acting up for quite a while now. On the way home Friday, it blew out the number 3 spark plug. That plug has already been coiled once before. The only way to fix would be a new head. With 197,000 miles on it, I can't see that being a good investement.</p>
<p>It was a good car. We really got our money's worth out of it. I actually have a lot of good and bad memories of that car. Good memories, like driving back to Minnesota for the weekend after I started with NorthStar Steel and driving to school at the U of Iowa etc. Bad ones, like trying to outrun a tornadoe outside of New Prague Minnesota, and also driving home through snowstorms when I worked for the man at Lockheed.</p>
<p>So, I am in the market for something a little different. I really enjoyed the S-10 Blazer that I had for about 6 years, so I think this may be a good time to pick up a gas guzzling SUV. Since I only drive 10 miles to work (when I am there), poor mpg it isn't that big of a deal.</p>
<p>At this point the candidates are Land Rover, Jeep, Exterra, and Land Cruiser. I would really like a Land Cruiser, and apparently, everyone else would to. They are hard to find.</p>
