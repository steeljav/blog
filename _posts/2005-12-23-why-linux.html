<p>With the issues that I have been having with doing a dist-upgrade in Debian, some people may wonder, "Why use Linux?". I have answered that question before <a href="http://www.billybryant.net/blog/archives/2005/10/index.html#a000065">here</a>. </p>
<p>But, I was asking myself yesterday why I keep using it when I have problems like I have had this week from doing distribution upgrades. Well, the short answer is that the issues usually aren't that major, and there is an immense amount of documentation out there to help out with the problems.</p>
