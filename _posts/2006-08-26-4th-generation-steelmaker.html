My wife was quick enough with the camera to get a picture of him. I thought it was pretty cool.</p>
<p>When we were bought by Gerdau we got new hardhats. I gave my son my old Northstar Steel hardhat. He thought it was pretty cool for a while, but I haven't seen it in a long time. Not sure where it dissapeared to.</p>
