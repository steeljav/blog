<p>I needed to look for something on the site and noticed it's been a while since I was here last. I've been busy.</p>

<p>I seem to say this every year about this time, but really intend to blog more this year. The issue is that every year seems to get busier and I think every post needs to be a work of art and so start drafts and don't finish. So I'll keep it in my head that short stats updates are ok.</p>

<p>Wordpress has really gotten complicated in the last few years.  I guess some people need the features but I'm ok with simple markdown.</p>
