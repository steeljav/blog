<p>I made a trip to Celaya Mexico last week. I was able to visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_de_Allende">San Miguel de Allende</a> which is a very cool little town out in the middle of nowhere. Our host took us to eat tacos at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Taquer%C3%ADa+El+Paisa/@20.5436381,-100.8425884,19z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sDeacero+aceria,+Celaya,+Gto.,+Mexico!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xd87d8c72215f9b25">a small taqueria</a> that we would have never stopped at on our own. It was excellent, the kind of off the beaten path place you would see on an Anthony Bourdain travel show. Over by the airport in Silao (BJX) <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Carnitas+el+Ricas/@20.9530311,-101.4379444,17z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x842b9b874a811a1f:0xe79e0a647f11914c!2sCarnitas+el+Ricas!3m1!1s0x842b9b874a811a1f:0xe79e0a647f11914c">this place</a> has excellent carnitas. This area is higher in elevation and so the weather was outstanding, not too hot, not too cold. I could get used to life there.</p>
