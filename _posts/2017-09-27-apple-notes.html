<p>My memory sucks and so I have to compensate for it by taking good notes and staying organized.Â I have been through several progressions of note taking apps. The order has been approximately as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>html files</li>
<li>ruby wiki</li>
<li>html files</li>
<li>OneNote</li>
<li>google docs</li>
<li>Evernote</li>
<li>OneNote</li>
<li>Apple Notes</li>
</ol>
<p>I briefly attempted to use google keep in between these someplace but gave up after a few weeks. It was early on in it's release and so it may be much better today.</p>
<p>I use a MacBook laptop and iPhone now and so decided to give Apple notes a try. I really recommend it if you need a simple note taking app that just works and stays synced between your apple devices, or just on your iPhone. The developers hit a perfect medium between a simple text file and an <a href="https://lifehacker.com/5666954/avoid-everything-buckets-aka-why-i-cant-get-into-apps-like-evernote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything bucket</a>. Give it a try if you haven't checked it out.</body></html></p>
