<p>I updated my annual subscription to MLB audio so that I can listen to Cubs games over the internet (remember when sports audio was free?). It still does not work with Linux. I haven't investigated what the issue is in depth, but I am starting to lean toward the idea that MLB intentionally kills the audio stream to anything that is not running on Micro$oft or Mac. It is strange because they have a powered by Sun banner on their homepage.</p>
