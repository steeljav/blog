<p>Despite the bad condition of the global steel industry (excluding China) and the very bad condition of electrode companies, 2015 was a decent year for me. I started thinking about a "best of" list for some reason and so put it together for the things that came to mind right away.</p>
<p><b>Best New Tech</b>: <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a><br />
I know that it has been around for several years, but I didn't start using it consistently until a few months ago. Evernote has made it much easier for me to stay organized. Dump everything into it and forget about it for a few weeks and see how easy it is to find it later. I like it so much that I upgraded to premium ($50 / yr) even though I didn't need the features. I just wanted to support the company.</p>
<p><b>Best New Steel Tech</b>: My colleague Dirk Riedinger from <a href="http://www.bse-kehl.de/en/bse/bse.php">BSE</a> gave a paper at the <a href="http://www.metec-tradefair.com/cipp/md_gmtn/custom/pub/content,oid,21230/lang,2/ticket,g_u_e_s_t/~/METEC_2015.html">METEC</a> conference. The presentation was titled "a new dimension of designing arc furnace high current systems" and detailed research he and his team have conducted into EAF secondary magnetic induction. I felt like I was the only person in the room that understood the potential of this technology. This is a big deal and I expect very good things to come from this.</p>
<p><b>Best Travel Trip</b>: Berlin<br />
I was stationed in Germany for 3 years in the USAF but never had the opportunity to visit Berlin. I finally made it there for a few rainy days over the summer. It is an awesome city and I would really like to spend a lot more time there.</p>
<p><b>Best Book</b>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Capital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty/dp/067443000X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451576043&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=capital+in+the+twenty-first+century">Capital in the 21rst Century</a><br />
This was the summer book to read in 2014, but I didn't get around to reading it until 2015. It's an excellent book and I can highly recommend it.</p>
<p><b>Best Movie</b>: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091191/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Lone Survivor</a><br />
I read the book and watched the movie. I don't like reading/hearing about US servicemen/women becoming casualties. I'm glad that the military allowed Mr Luttrell to tell his story. Hopefully the military learned from this and incidents like this don't happen again.</p>
<p><b>Best TV Series</b>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans_%282013_TV_series%29">The Americans</a><br />
Season 3 aired in 2015 on FX. It just keeps getting better. <a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/the-americans/episodes">Season 4</a> starts in March.</p>
<p><b>Best Music</b>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_%28album%29">Mastodon Leviathon</a><br />
This was released in 2004 but I bought it this year and was blown away. This was a really tough choice between this and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_Pt._2:_Scenes_from_a_Memory">Dream Theater's Metropolis Pt 2</a> which I also bought this year and was blown away by.</p>
<p><b>Best Meal</b>: Tacos at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Taquer%C3%ADa+El+Paisa/@20.539789,-100.8481708,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xd87d8c72215f9b25">Taqueria El Paisa</a><br />
This is a small taqueria in Celaya Mexico. A colleague took us there for a late quick supper. The tacos were outstanding, and cheap.</p>
<p><b>Best Fitness Lesson</b>: Be careful with protein<br />
This year I learned that certain proteins such as whey and amino acid supplements can cause spikes in insulin levels. This is similar to the response from high glycemic carbohydrates and results in fat storage. I started losing weight (fat) as soon as I reduced my whey intake to &lt;25g / day and eliminated amino acid supplements.</p>
