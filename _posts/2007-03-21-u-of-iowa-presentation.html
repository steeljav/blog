<p>I have been asked by the U of Iowa to do a presentation for the Engineering Graduate College Seminar Series. I will talk about my Master's Thesis and probably system identification work in the steel industry. I haven't looked at my thesis in just about a year. I need to do some serious reviewing.</p>
<p>April and May are going to be crazy months.</p>
