<p>I finished reading <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780143038276&amp;itm=2">The Cold War by John Lewis Gaddis</a> last week. It was an easy read, about 350 pages. I was able to read it in my spare time over a few weeks. The book provides just the highest level details about the beginnings of the cold war after WWII up through the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Cold War history and want an easy read, this book is for you.</p>
