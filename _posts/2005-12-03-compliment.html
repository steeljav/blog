<p>A technical person that I work with told me that he thought I should apply with google because he thought that I was exactly the type of person they look for. So, I guess I should take that as a compliment, considering that they only hire like the top 5th percentile. But, I don't necessarily agree with him. They get thousands of resumes per day, and they seem to want computer science phd types, and I am an electrical engineer ms type.</p>
<p>The problem with Google is that they pay in the lower 50th percentile and they are located in an area that is one of the most expensive places in the US to live. For someone like me to pack up and go there, I would be sacrificing a lot for the job. It just doesn't seem like a good tradeoff. Chances are high that I would never be able to afford what I have here, there.</p>
