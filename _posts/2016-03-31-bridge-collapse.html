<p>I saw a documentary on BBC a few months ago about a bridge building project in India and the problems it was plagued with. I remember being dumbfounded by the technical incompetence of the project managers and Engineers and the interference of the politicians demagoging for attention. I'm not a bridge builder but I do know they are technically difficult and a major public safety concern. The BBC is reportingÂ <a href="//www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-35933452">their bridge just collapsed</a>. Really sorry to hear this but can't say I'm surprised.</p>
