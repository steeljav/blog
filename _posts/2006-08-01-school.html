<p>I finished an MSEE at the U of Iowa in May. I feel like I have been out of school forever. I have kind of been asking myself "Now What?" lately. Sometimes I am not sure that I am completely ready to be done with school. Sometimes I feel like I should just go ahead and start taking classes and doing research to work towards a Phd in EE. But, then I kind of feel like I need to quit messing around with taking classes and start focusing on making $$.</p>
<p>I am in a fortunate position. My employer re-imburses tuition/fees/books, and is flexible with the schedule.</p>
<p>I guess I am just messed up because normally at this point in the summer I would be in a huge rush to finish projects in and around the house before school started again. This time, I don't have to be in a big rush to get summer projects finished.</p>
