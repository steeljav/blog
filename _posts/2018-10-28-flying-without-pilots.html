<p>I've read a bunch of articles like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/business/airplanes-unmanned-flight-autopilot.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">this one</a>Â covering pilot-less air travel. There always seems to be a majority in favor of this and no shortage of quotes from people claiming they would be ok with or even prefer flying without pilots. I used to work on aircraft avionics and have a good feel for how often there are problems. There is no way I will fly on an pilot-less aircraft. I suspect the media is skewing things and most of the flying public wouldn't either.</p>
