<p>I am excited. We got our tickets today to go see the Rayados (stripes) play Atlas. The Rayados are actually named Monterrey, but their shirts are striped so they are also known as the Rayados. I have been told that being a Rayados fan is similar to being a Chicago Cubs fan. Since I have been a Chicago Cubs fan for many years, I think that I will fit right in with the Rayados fans.</p>
<p>I have been told that the games are usually televised on Galavision. You might be able to see me there. The game starts at 1700.</p>
