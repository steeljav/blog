<p>The <a href="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a> had <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126135856019499555.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsSecond">an article</a> in yesterday's decade in review section that provided some sorry metrics (for most Americans) for the 00's. The <a href="http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/wsj_DecadeStep091220.pdf">charts</a> really sum it up: </p>
<p class="quote">Change in personal income: +5 Percent<br><br> Change in net worth: -14 percent<br><br> Change in employment: +0.5 percent</p>
<p>They note that the economy gained virtually no jobs while the population grew by 35 million. It is not clear what percentage of those 35 million entered the workforce however. It would have been good if they would have included a measure of the change in one of the cost of living metrics.</p>
