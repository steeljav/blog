<p>After ~7 years of being an android phone user I bought an iPhone 6S Plus and I couldn't be happier with it. I did have an iPod touch that I used for about a year in between somewhere.</p>
<p><!--more-->I needed to get a new phone anyway and decided on either the google Nexus or the iPhone. The main reason I decided against the Nexus was that I was tired of the Android weirdness. This may not have been an issue with the Nexus, but it has been an issue with every other Android phone I have had. By Android weirdness I mean strange things happening on the phone like it randomly heating up for no reason, rebooting for no reason, etc. A few other things about Android bothered me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Very few droid phones still have micro SD slots. I saw that as a major advantage over the iPhone. I have no idea why manufacturers quit including it.</li>
<li>All of the manufacturers (HTC, LG, Samsung, etc.) put their bloatware on their droid phones and you can not get rid of it.</li>
<li>If you get a droid phone from your carrier it will have their bloatware on it and you can not get rid of it.</li>
<li>I was tired of dealing with apps that only work partially on the Android platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are probably a few other things I'm forgetting about but the main thing was that I wanted an unlocked phone that didn't have bloatware, wouldn't randomly do unexplainable weird things and that all apps would work on. The iPhone meets all of those requirements.</body></html></p>
