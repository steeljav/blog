<p>A short article about <a href="http://www.wbez.org/blog/john-r-schmidt/2012-01-13/blizzard-79-fun-mike-and-jane-95513">the blizzard of 1979</a>. I was 7 but remember this well and still have some pictures. We were 2 hours West of the city, but got hammered at least as hard, maybe worse.</p>
<p>I kind of remember that they actually closed down the steel mill (Northwestern Steel and Wire) where my father worked and sent everyone home due to the cold. A lot of the equipment uses water for cooling and it was freezing up. That didn't happen very often.</p>
