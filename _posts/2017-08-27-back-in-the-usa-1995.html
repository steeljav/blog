<p>When I was in the USAF and stationed in Germany I got pretty homesick for some reason. I was younger and not at all prepared for the cultural differences between the rest of the world and the USA. And back then I had no interest in leaving the USA and didn't request oversees duty (which is probably why I got it!).</p>
<p>I flew home through Ohare last week and saw the flag hanging over the exit and it reminded me of how happy I was when I returned home and saw it. I didn't leave North America for 20 years after that.</p>
<p>Being a little older and more mature I really enjoy Europe now and would not have any issues living there at all.</p>
