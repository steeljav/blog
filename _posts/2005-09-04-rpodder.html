<p>I finally gave up on trying to get what I wanted out of JPodder, perlpodder and rubypodder, and I rolled my own. <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=913&amp;release_id=2875">rpodder</a> is a ruby script to download podcasts either from the command line, or from a cron job. I have tested it out with several different podcasts and it seems to be working. It is very, very beta at this point. I coded this in about 5 hours today. Any feedback from the use of this would be very appreciated.</p>
