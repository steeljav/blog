<p>I got back from Oklahoma today. It was a good trip. I was in the Tulsa area. Tulsa seems like a very nice area, along the lines of Knoxville. A decent sized town, but not so big that it is crowded and busy.</p>
<p>The Tulsa airport is one of the nicest airports I have been in. At some point, they must have consulted a designer/artist. It is really cool. However, it needs 2 things to make it to the top of my list. The first thing is a Starbucks. I saw that they are putting one in today, so that covers one of them. The other thing is that they need to set up free wireless. They have wireless, but it is pay by the hour. It needs to be free.</p>
