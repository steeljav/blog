<p><a href="http://www.billybryant.net/pics/germany/trier1.jpg"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2006/12/trier1.jpg" alt="pic" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 4px 0;" width="120" height="90"></a>I started scanning a lot of the pictures that I have from when I was in the USAF. Many of the pictures are not of the greatest quality and I don't have the negatives. I took this picture somewhere between Kaiserslautern and Trier Germany on autobahn A1. There is a small pulloff on the autobahn, that has some trails and this beautiful view. The town in the distance is Trier, and the river is the Mosel. The crops on the sides of the hills are grapes for wine of course.</p>
<p>I really like this picture because of the contrast in colors, and it shows how beautiful the Mosel region of Germany is. I am glad that it scanned in so well.</p>
