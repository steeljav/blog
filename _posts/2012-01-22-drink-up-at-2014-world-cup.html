<p>A <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16624823">BBC article</a> quotes <a href="http://www.fifa.com">FIFA</a> general secretary Jerome Valcke stating "beer must be sold" at all venues at the Brazil World Cup in 2014. Apparently Brazil has a law banning alcohol sales at certain soccer matches. I have been to three soccer matches in Brazil and purchased and drank beer both outside and inside the stadiums and so I am a little confused by this. Maybe the law is only for matches with the national team?</p>
