It is such a cool vehicle to drive. I got a really good deal on it. It needs a little work, but I think in general it has been taken care of fairly well. This is my new work vehicle. It will also be sort of a hobby vehicle for me to mess with. I can't wait for it to snow to see how the traction enhancement feature works.</p>
<p>When I travel for work, I always rent a car when I get to where I am going. Since owning the Disco, when I get into a car, I feel like I can't see and I am cramped. The nicest thing about the Disco is how well you can see everything around you. It is really impressive.</p>
