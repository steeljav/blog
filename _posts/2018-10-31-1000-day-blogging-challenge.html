<p>I read <a href="https://seths.blog/">this guy's blog</a> once in a while. He's a thought leader in the marketing world. He blogs every day. He posted about <a href="https://seths.blog/2018/10/the-first-1000-are-the-most-difficult/">blogging daily for the first 1000 days</a>. I'm pretty sure I would fail miserably, but totally agree that it would improve writing ability in a big way if you stuck it out.Â </p>
