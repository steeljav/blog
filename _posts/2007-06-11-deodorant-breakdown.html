<p>Wired has another what's inside breakdown up this month <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/15-06/st_axe">here</a>. This month's breakdown is for stick anti-perspirant. From the article: </p>
<p class="quote">Nearly every antiperspirant has a mineral, usually aluminum that dissolves into the skin with the first beads of sweat. This active ingredient causes underarm pores to swell shut, which stops more sweat from seeping out. And it kills odor-causing bacteria.</p>
<p>I have to say, I am not real excited about the thought of aluminum being absorbed into my system. It can't be good.</p>
