<p>I have done a significant amount of cleaning while I have been home over the holidays. I have gotten most of the things that I wanted to get done finished.</p>
<p>I have finally cleaned out my closet and donated everything to Goodwill. I spent some time cleaning up my woodworking shop. It is actually useable again. I cleaned up my office, which was a total disaster. I also spent some time cleaning the basement. I through out a lot of junk but I still feel like I should be getting rid of more. I had a good friend in the USAF. He lived very frugally and simple. He didn't have much. I remember when he PCS'd from Spangdahlem he was able to fit everything into 2 duffle bags with the exception of his PC. I haven't talked to him since 1995, I wonder if he is still that way.</p>
