<p>Travel went pretty well last week. I went to Beaumont Texas for a few days. United got me there on time, and got me home on time. That hasn't happened in quite a while. I stayed at the MCM Elegante hotel in Beaumont, it was the first time that I have stayed there. It was a nice hotel with the exception of the rude staff.</p>
