<p>Another weekend went by in a flash. I was able to get a few things done this weekend. I finihsed the octagon table. I finally got the porch windows painted. I read a couple chapters out of David Allen's Getting Things Done. It was really hot again. I should have taken a picture of the thermometer. It was ridiculous, like 105, and humid. I came back to the Mid-West to escape the heat of phoenix.</p>
<p>Back to work tomorrow. Bummer.</p>
