<p>Happy New Year everyone. Hope 2011 and the holidays were good to you, the year went by in a flash for me. The best part of my 2011 was finally selling the house in Iowa and relocating to Illinois. It has saved me 8 hours and 25 gallons of gas every week.</p>
<p>I live a fairly disciplined life and so I don't really have any major resolutions for 2012. However, I would like to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog more than I have in the last few years.</li>
<li>Write and publish 2 technical papers.</li>
</ul>
<p></body></html></p>
