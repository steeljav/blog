<p>When I was in college for my undergraduate degree I was required to take a coures in music apreciation. I was not very happy about it at the time. I remember talking to my councelor and explaining that I had played guitar most of my life and that I should take a Jazz Improvization course that was offered instead. He explained that it would be a big PITA (Pain In The Ass) in terms of administration and that I would have to audition etc. I told him that I had no problem doing an audition and would prefer to learn something instead of just checking a box. Basically, I was not able to get him to sign off on it unfortunately, and I ended up taking the music appreciation course.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no regrets about taking the music appreciation course. I have always respected and apreciated classical music, and the course filled in many of the blanks that I had about classical music and the artistic periods of history.</p>
<p>For some reason lately I have felt like listening to classical, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_music">Romantic Period</a> to be specific which contains my favorite composers. I purchased some mp3's from amazon, but then found that there is a lot of music available from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Commons"> Wikimedia Commons</a> that has been donated from various sources and appears to be recorded in <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg Vorbis</a> which makes sense.</p>
<p>Just wanted to say thanks to all of the people/performers that donated the music. Being able to legally download un-encumbered outstanding music is really cool.</p>
