<p>I'm working on a project to model, simulate and predict performance of an EAF with two different transformers. I've done this many times, starting with my Master's thesis in 2006. What's different this time is that I've been using <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> extensively for process analysis and am using it for this project.</p>
<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Faraway-PRA.pdf">Practical Regression and ANOVA Using R</a> is a great reference. Wish I would have had this for my thesis because it would have saved me a lot of time.</p>
