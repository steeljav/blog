<p>My wife and I went to see Anthrax and Judas Priest last night at the Mark in Moline Illinois. I haven't posted anything in a while, I have been pretty damn busy with school stuff, but I thought that I should take a few minutes to say something about these guys.</p>
<p>I have been an Anthrax fan since I was in high school. I still listen to them once in a while and was pretty excited about being able to see them finally. Joey Belladonna is singing for them again, which is pretty cool. I liked the stuff that they did with John Bush, but I liked everything with Joey better. They pretty much rocked, but I think they need a new sound guy. They had several problems with the sound. I couldn't hear the lead guitar parts most of the time, and Joey Belladonna's mic was screwed up a few times. They played several tunes off of Among the Living, a few off of Persistance of Time, no new stuff. They have a greatest hits out, I should buy it.</p>
<p>Judas Priest pretty much rocked also. Most of the crowd obviously came to see Priest. I was hoping that they would play a lot of their older stuff. They played mostly newer stuff. They played for about 2 hours. It was loud, and sounded good. Too bad Anthrax couldn't have borrowed their sound guy. Rob Halford has such an awesome stage presence. My wife said that the Quad City Times newspaper knocked Halford. I don't know why. I thought he was great. They even brought the bike with them, and Rob rode it out on stage, that was cool. I really need to pick up Judas Priest's greatest hits, or else just start buying all of their old releases.</p>
<p>If you have a chance to go see these guys, I would recommend it. At least if you are a metal head anyway.</p>
