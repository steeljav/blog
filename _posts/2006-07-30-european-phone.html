<p>I was changing the ringer on my cell phone the other day and I found that it has a ringer that sounds like the way a German phone rings (or at least used to when I was there). I consider it to be a more pleasant, less annoying ring than the standard bells, or electronically synthesized annoyances that are prevalent today in the US. So, I thought that it would be nice to by new land-line phones for the house (I don't like ours) that are the Euro variety. I searched on Google, Froogle and e-bay, but no luck. I remember that the ring voltages are slightly different, but compatible. It looks like I am going to be going back to Germany in October, so I may end up having to pick up a phone then and bring it back.</p>
<p>Anyone know where I can buy a Europhone?</p>
