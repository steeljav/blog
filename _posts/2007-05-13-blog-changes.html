<p>I finally got around to making some changes to the blog template and css. This took a lot longer than I thought. Mostly due to my inexperience with css, it really seems to be overly complicated. The banner was the best I could do with <a href="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a> and a short amount of time. I gave the blog changes quite a bit of thought, but in the end I decided to adhere to my philosophy of KISS.</p>
<p>I have also decided to try to do a tech tip of the week and a picture of the week. I am thinking about giving out a *?$!head of the month award also, I am pretty sure I have found a few competitive candidates. Additionally, I will post simple movie and book reviews as they come up. </p>
<p>If you have comments or suggestions on the blog, please let me know.</p>
