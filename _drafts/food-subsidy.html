<p>Washington post link from last year that has links to other data sources on farm subsidies</p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/why-do-taxpayers-subsidize-rich-farmers/2018/03/15/50e89906-27b6-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.ba53c3bda790</p>

<p>I recently visited the EU and stayed in Airbnb in order to avoid eating out every meal (see here). I expected to pay significantly more for groceries especially in Berlin and Paris. Partly do to the exchange rate and partly due to the cost of living. It was the opposite, I was surprised by how cheap groceries are and the quality of the food compared to the USA.</p>
<p>Specifically, the bread, cheese, milk, sausage in Germany and Poland, etc. European food goes bad rapidly because it's not full of preservatives. A baguette will last 1 day at best, it's made from scratch.</p>
<p>Here's a pricing comparison:</p>
<p>- milk</p>
<p>- bread</p>
<p>- cheese</p>
<p>- sausage</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>What's going on? US agriculture is heavily subsidized both directly and indirectly. Why isn't this passed on to the consumer?</p>
