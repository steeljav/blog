<p>It's easy for management to initiate:<br />
- people sell it.<br />
- it's everywhere.</p>
<p>It's just a process:<br />
- CMM level 3? At best.<br />
- Doesn't have continuous improvement built in. Management of the six sigma process is focused on process improvement and doesn't account for improvement of the six sigma process. No metrics collected. At each stage of a process should measure:<br />
- Time<br />
- Level of effort (labor hours)<br />
- Size of deliverable(s) (number of pages, SLOC, etc.).<br />
- Defects</p>
<p>It pulls everyone to the mean. It is typically a rigid process. Less experienced employees will benefit from it, highly experienced employees will be crippled by it.</p>
