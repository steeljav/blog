<p>I had an interesting discussion with a friend / colleague / customer recently concerning hiring and retention of entry to mid level talent in the EAF steel industry. As an industry we have struggled to attract and keep talented entry level Engineers for at least the last 10 years. This is particularly a problem for Electrical Engineers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm in a privileged position from the standpoint of being blessed to work with many different facilities, companies and people in the industry. One of my core offerings is training for EAF power and control systems. My courses are typically made up of Metallurgical Engineers, operators, Electrical and Automation Techs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It seems like every industry event I've attended in the last ~10 years (AISTech, METEC, AIST Globetrotters, SMA, etc.) the coming wave of retirees and not enough talent to fill in has been brought up. We can't say we haven't seen this coming, and it is probably going to get worse (at least here in the USA).</p>

<p>Where are all of the Electrical Engineering grads going? The Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172071.htm">stats on Electrical Engineers</a>. There is nothing specifically provided for entry level or by years of experience. However, judging by the top paying industries and the industries with the highest concentrations of EEs it's probably safe to guess:</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Note that the above are at least 4 years old and so wages have increased.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>Compensation: It isn't great compared to other industries. Especially longer term.</li>
<li>Environment: Dirty, hot, cold, loud.</li>
<li>Work life balance: bad hours, always on call, lack of vacation.</li>
<li>Advancement opportunities: not very good.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What can any employer offer: compensation, vacation, work environment (challenging assignments, advancement opportunities, etc.). The only thing that can change would be vacation and/or work life balance. This is going to have to change to attract real talent.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The steel industry has to change if it wants to attract more electrical engineering talent. Note that we are not talking about the "best and brightest", but simply experienced electrical engineers willing to work in the facilities.</p>
