<p>Background:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Long time linux user.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using looking versions of pycharm, intelij, rstudio and and a few others. Everything works.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Good:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>No fans - no worries about getting hot and not getting airflow from sitting on constricted surface.</li>
<li>battery</li>
<li>responsiveness</li>
<li>keyboard - the best keyboard I have typed on in memory. Perfect balance between too mushy and too hard. Prefer something more firm.</li>
<li>sound - reasonable for the size</li>
<li>size / weight</li>
<li>overall build quality</li>
<li>Run chromeos, android apps (some) and linux software side by side!!!!</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not So Good:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Copying between linux container (AKA penguin) clipboard to chrome OS clipboard is not possible. This is an issue for me because I create analytic graphics in an app like RStudio and want to annotate and paste them into emails. Can't do this.</li>
<li>No good way to annotate graphics. End up pasting into google slides and creating a pdf slide instead of just annotating the graphic directly.</li>
<li>Linux app fonts are really small. May be a way to adjust this, but don't know. Some apps open very small.</li>
<li>cloud print not working, wtf?</li>
<li>some apps not working. not google's fault, not really developer's fault. but got no response from them: Plume.</li>
<li>run out of scroll / select room when doing a region select. sure I'm probably missing something. but having to put another finger on the trackpad to continue the selection seems like a mistake in interface design.</li>
<li>multiple desktops not yet implemented. there's a workaround involving multiple user accounts, but not really what I'm looking for.</li>
<li>stability of the dev channel could be better. weird things get broken, like scrolling of bookmarks list in chrome.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Differences:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>The trackpad is different. Don't double tap to indicating end of selection, just lift. Minor issue but there's no button.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Recommendations:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Add a double tap to hold to the track pad.</li>
</ul>
