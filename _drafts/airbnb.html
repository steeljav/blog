<p>Went on vacation and used Airbnb. I've used home away in the past but this was a first for Airbnb and was it off the country. Just wanted to note a few things about the experience.</p>
<p>If you're only staying for a night or 2 then things can't be that bad. But if you're staying for a week or 2 then do your homework. Choose from rentals with history and a lot of comments so you can get the good and bad.</p>
<p>Make sure you get a contact for the person responsible. If something goes wrong you are at their mercy. The internet died at one of the rentals. After translating the ISP splash page we figured out that they hadn't paid the bill. It was the 1rst of the month. I tried to contact the manager using the number listed and never got a reply.</p>
<p>Ask about the things that are important before renting. If you need to sleep at night ask about street noise, loud neighbors, etc. Is there construction going on across the street? It won't show in the pictures. Is there construction going on in the apartment upstairs using a hammer drill and grinders at 7AM? It won't show up in the pictures.</p>
<p>Be specific about your needs. If you need 2 beds, a couch and extra blankets make sure your host know this ahead of time.</p>
