<p>What's up with the lack of innovation in EAF steel production? EAF steel producers used to be happy to take a small risk for a small gain. Since the crash of 2007 things have really changed. No one seems to be willing to take small risks to make small incremental improvements.</p>
<p>Today everyone seems to want to be paid to take no risk to be provided with low hanging fruit that will cut costs in half.</p>
