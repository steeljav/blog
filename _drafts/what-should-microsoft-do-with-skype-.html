<p>Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion. Not a huge investment for a $400 billion company, but hopefully they have a plan. They need to quit trying to be the first to be second (or third) and do something innovative. Microsoft has the opportunity and ability to do something innovative and disruptive with Skype while giving a desperately needed boost to the Windows Phone: end international SMS and voice charges.</p>
<p>Skype is in a way a union of messaging platforms. It can be used to send messages or make voice and video calls to other Skype users anywhere for free. SMS messages can be sent for a fee. Calls can be made internationally for competitive rates. Unlimited calls can be made within the US and Canada for a flat rate of $30/yr. A phone number can be purchased for $30/Yr.</p>
<p>Skype already has a network of wifi partners that it uses to sell access to wifi globally. This is called Skype wifi.</p>
<p>Messaging like every other messaging app, telephony, conferencing,</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it like google fi.</li>
<li>Apps for all devices - no big change here.</li>
<li>Free Skype to Skype calls from/to any platform - no change here.</li>
<li>Free unlimited international SMS as long as connected to wifi to send, cell network to receive. Skype currently charges for SMS and so this is a change from the existing platform.</li>
<li>Unlimited international calls for a low monthly fee ~$10. Free for users of windows phone.</li>
</ul>
