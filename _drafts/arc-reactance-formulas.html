<p>Several researchers have established that 3-phase EAF arcs generate a time-varying non-linear reactance during EAF operation. There have been many formulas developed (I know of at least ~8) over the last 50 years. Since I had data in Minitab and it makes statistical analysis so easy I decided to try to validate a couple of the relationships that I know of. I have not been able to do it. I plan to continue working on this and to state my findings (at least informally). </p>
