<p>I have been working on a 3-phase EAF simulation using the methods of symmetrical components off and on for some time now. The 3-phase EAF simulation that I developed for <a href="http://www.billybryant.net/eafat">EAFAT</a> just utilizes standard circuit analysis techniques. It is accurate but probably more computationally intensive than it needs to be. It isn't an issue at this time but may be a problem for some of the future development that I am planning.</p>
<p>For those that may not know, the methods of symmetric components are heavily utilized for fault analysis. Since an EAF is a controlled 3-phase fault it would seem logical to utilize the methods of symmetric components for circuit analysis of an EAF. Additionally, using symmetric components would be much less computationally intensive. The problem that I keep running into is that it seems like there is an implicit assumption that the fault under analysis is balanced and this not the case for (most) EAFs. However, I can not give up on this method until I can prove or disprove the feasibility of it either way.</p>
