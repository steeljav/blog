<p>I've used gvim and the terminal for software development for a long time now. It really is possible to move mountains in keystrokes with vim. I've tried IDEs in the past, mostly Nebeans for java development. It was ok, but not enough to keep from wanting to move back to gvim and a terminal.</p>
<p>I asked some ex-colleague developers what they were using and they recommended IntelliJ hands down. I've read multiple accounts of developers happily paying the license fee because of the productivity boost it provides. This sounded good to me, so I shelled out the $$$ for the license and dove in.</p>
<p>The deployment feature is nice, but not robust enough for my uses. The limitation that I ran into was that it requires files being uploaded to be in the project. My jar file is located in the directory above the project along with a common configuration directory. It would be ideal if it had an option to run a script after the build for people like myself that have non-standard deployment requirements. I just wrote a bash script to upload my files using rsync, but unfortunately I have to run it manually.</p>
