<p>I put together a web page for the Electric Arc Furnace analysis software that I have been working on. It is located <a href="http://www.bryantsolutions.biz/eafat/eafat.html"> here</a>. I am calling this EAFAT for short. I wanted to think of a better acronym but couldn't come up with anything else.</p>
<p>I think that this is a really nice piece of software. I wish that I would have had it about 5 years ago, it would have saved me a lot of trouble. I will be doing additional development around it. There are several features that I want to add. However, the software is absolutely usable as it is today. If you need to make adjustments to an EAF control system, the EAFAT is your friend.</p>
<p>I am working on configuration of the web page to allow trials of the software over the net. It is possible since this is a java app, but I have been running into problems with the configuration. Stay tuned.</p>
