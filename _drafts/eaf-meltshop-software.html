<p>Software running in an EAF melt shop must be robust.</p>
<p>If it can happen it will.</p>
<p>You must plan for every contingency: power loss, network outage, loss of field devices, etc.</p>
<p>Planning is great, but you must also test for every contingency.</p>
<p>You will have limited update opportunities. You have to get it right the first time.</p>
<p>It can not impose a burden on the local maintenance staff. They will only restart it so many times.</p>
<p>Every facility is different, every furnace is different, every operation is different. This makes it incredibly difficult to develop logic that is broadly applicable without customization. It is very difficult to avoid developing logic that is custom for each facility. Couple this with the reality that it is a commodity business and therefore cash constrained and it explains why so much software found in melt shops is abysmal.</p>
