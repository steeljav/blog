<p>It's <a href="http://www.esfi.org/program/national-electrical-safety-month-314" target="_blank">Electrical Safety Month</a> and so I thought I would share some thoughts and observations on it and safety in general.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In three job interviews in the steel industry I have been asked about my thoughts on safety once. My response was and still is: safety is hard. We spend money, brains and time working on it and yet we still have colleagues injured and killed every year. Safety issues are typically complex and I don’t pretend to have any silver bullets, however, I have had the opportunity to work in diverse facilities globally, meet and talk with many in the industry and make many observations. The goal of this discussion is to detail some of those safety observations and experiences I have had. This is mainly with regards to Electrical Safety but applicable to safety in general.</span></p>
<p>Safety doesn’t have to be so hard. In many cases it is made that way by expecting world class results without world class commitment and resources. The EAF steel industry is highly cost driven and capital is therefore constrained, especially in down markets. Electrical safety in particular can be very dependent on capital and resources.</p>
<p>Some form of arc flash analysis is now required in most of the world. The main output of the arc flash analysis is the incident energy rating and hazard category at each bus, device, node, etc. in an industrial facility. The hazard category indicates what level of PPE is required to be protected from a fault, assuming that all protective devices operate properly. The ubiquitousness of arc flash studies has been a big step forward for electrical safety. Unfortunately there are several ways that things can go wrong and the hourly technician doing the work has no control over:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;">
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Technical Issues</span></span><span style="font-weight:400;">: Accurate hazard category ratings depend upon accurate information being provided to a competent vendor capable of performing a complex analysis, which requires capital and/or resources. Unfortunately some facilities have treated the analysis as an unnecessary cost that they would should not have to incur. The analysis is contracted to the lowest bidder and conducted using the minimal amount of information and participation by staff at the facility (if at all). The result is inevitably a highly inaccurate analysis resulting in inaccurate hazard categories.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Maintenance Issues</span></span><span style="font-weight:400;">: Accurate hazard category ratings are predicated upon breakers and relays functioning properly. Proper breaker and relay operation requires maintenance and service at proper intervals which requires capital and/or resources. If a breaker or relay fail to operate then the hazard category is almost guaranteed to be something higher because the fault must be cleared by the next upstream breaker and relay resulting in the incident radiative energy being applied for a longer period of time. Many facilities do not perform adequate breaker and/or relay maintenance.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Documentation Issues</span></span><span style="font-weight:400;">: Accurate hazard category ratings are predicated on accurate technical documentation. Schematics, breaker types, transformer information, relay types and settings, cable specifications, lengths and spacing, etc. all matter. Accurate documentation requires resources and/or capital to maintain. I have frequently encountered erroneous or non-existent documentation. Very few facilities still have CAD technicians on staff to maintain schematics and documentation. The result is that things get lost, confused, mislabeled, etc. and “as-built” schematics are not 100% accurate “as-built”.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;">
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Economic Issues</span></span><span style="font-weight:400;">: Maintenance budgets get reduced during weak economic conditions. Proper prioritization of electrical maintenance should utilize electrical safety as the main consideration which would require that an Engineer be responsible and provided the capital and resources to analyze failure scenarios. Very few facilities have a staff Engineer who is provided the time and resources to accomplish this. Very few steel mills would be able to state with any certainty what the hazard category of a bus is if the breaker or relay failed to operate. This requires a talented Electrical Engineer with the appropriate documentation, software and time to answer properly.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The trend has been to make the individual aware that he/she is responsible for their own safety. This is obviously correct but the state of the equipment has a large influence over the safety of the individual with regards to electrical safety. Managers control capital and resources, not hourly technicians. Management therefore has a large influence over the Electrical Safety of a facility.</p>
<p>Some safety departments attempt to eliminate electrical safety concerns by instituting a ”no live work” policy. This is a good policy, but unfortunately things aren’t so black and white. A piece of equipment being maintained may be de-energized, but surrounded by live systems supplying load and it may not be feasible to de-energize the entire upstream feed because it also supplies critical loads (cooling water, crane power, lighting, air compressors required in another part of the process, etc.). These situations come up frequently and it is not satisfactory to declare ”no live work” if the staff are not empowered to stop the entire process on the grounds of safety without fear of reprimand or criticism.</p>
<p>Many steel mills still utilize electromechanical protective relays. These relays were the best technology that 1950 had to offer. They are susceptible to dust and vibration, 2 things that are plentiful in a steel mill. Their contact surfaces tend to oxidize over time and require annual cleaning. When these devices are placed in dirty environments they should be serviced every six months. I have replaced many of these relays that were on critical supply feeds with much more reliable and faster digital relays. The project could not be justified on increased safety, because it didn’t have a payback and so “wasn’t in the budget”. It had to be justified using an improvement in energy metering which would result in a reduction in energy consumption and ROI.</p>
<p>Being a father and husband I feel very strongly about this topic. I can't imagine having to tell a family that their mother/father/husband/wife came to work, did everything they were trained to do to work safely but were severely injured or killed because of a lack of the necessary capital or resources. Unfortunately I have worked in facilities that have caused me to be very concerned for the safety of myself and everyone around me and my recommendations and concerns fell on deaf ears. “It's not in the budget”, non-empowered “No live work” policies, “We don’t do work over hazard category 2” are not replacements for capital and resources required to provide a safe working environment.</p>
<p>I have had the privilege to visit, tour and work in many steel mills around the world. I haven’t always been asked to explicitly contribute to safety, but when I have it typically goes something like ”we know you see a lot of facilities and we want to improve so please look around and let us know if you see any opportunities where we can improve safety.” Unfortunately after 13+ years I have realized that in most cases this is lip service. Because as soon as a recommendation requiring capital or resources is made the problem is aggressively discounted. If it only happened once it would be a fluke, if it happened twice it would be a concern, but after multiple times it becomes discouraging. I have made multiple safety recommendations to plants (at their request) and can only recall one time that a recommendation was followed through on and completed. I have had colleagues told to remove safety recommendations from their trip reports. This is not acceptable.</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity to direct the replacement of more EAF transformers than I care to remember.  A transformer vault is required (by electrical code) to contain an arc blast and fire in the event that the ~8000 gallons of transformer oil ignited. At one facility I had to convince a Plant Manager, Melt Shop Superintendent and Engineering Manager to properly seal a transformer vault wall. The vault was made of cement block and the front wall had not been tied in properly after removal and replacement of the transformer. Every time the vault door was opened the front wall swayed from the change in air pressure. The transformer was a Humpty Dumpty disaster that was pieced together because the shop didn't have a spare. The transformer was tested and released for service but the probability of failure on first energization was high. I was absolutely dumbfounded that 3 highly paid, experienced managers would advocate for energization of this transformer with inadequate vault containment. A failure could have resulted in concrete shrapnel and burning transformer oil covering the EAF deck and was a direct violation of state electrical code. I got my way, but had to refuse to be on-site for energization until the vault wall was properly sealed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">An electrical safety program requires commitment from the Plant and Department Managers down to the hourly technicians:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Empower the hourly technicians to stop the process without fear of reprimand or criticism if it is necessary in order to do a task safely.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Spend as much money, brains and time as possible on the arc flash study.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Commit the necessary resources to maintain the arc flash study and technical documentation, preferably in house.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hire a competent Electrical Engineer and provide them with the training and resources to maintain a power system model of the plant to use for prioritization of electrical maintenance with regard to safety.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Do the right thing regardless of economic cycle.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What else can be done to improve the Electrical Safety culture in a facility? Participation in the <a href="http://www.ewh.ieee.org/cmte/ias-esw/" target="_blank">IEEE Electrical Safety Workshop</a> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">is a good starting point. Participation should be not only by the maintenance management and supervisors, but most importantly by the people actually doing the work, the electrical technicians. Talk to your people, frequently. When they detail electrical issues provide the resources necessary to mitigate them.</span><br />
