<p>By "Melt Shop" I mean EAF only.</p>
<p>I've had several interesting conversations lately with Melt Shop Managers and Engineers that made me think. What will it take to get to a completely un-manned EAF operation and how long will it be before we get there?</p>

<p>Scrap loading may take some time but is certainly feasible with todays technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's coming. Just a matter of time.</p>
