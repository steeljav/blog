<p>If you are going to model an EAF (or any analog system really) then it is important to choose a language that doesn't work against you. I've implemented an EAF power and control system model in several languages over the years and have found the most important factor to be native support for handling complex numbers.</p>
<p>Several languages have native support of complex numbers, others require external libraries/classes or require you to develop your own. Some examples:</p>
<p>ruby and python:<br />
<code><br />
z1 = 1 + 3j<br />
z2 = 0.5 - 1.6j<br />
z1 * z2 = 5.3 - 0.1j<br />
</code><br />
