<p>When I was a kid growing up I practiced guitar constantly. Sometimes 8 to 10 hours a day. This was the late 80's hair metal era and the time of metal guitar virtuosos. I wanted to be a virtuoso. </p>

<li>The market is very limited.</li>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum there are guitarists that have limited knowledge but much wider appeal. Angus Young has made a very good living for himself using about 3 chords.</p>
