<p>Not taught properly on 6 signs courses. Have all heats and so the population not samples. No need for p values or hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>Here's a good pdf from UCLA that explains how to calculate and evaluate confidence intervals of means, and gives a non-normal example: http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~rgould/110as02/bsci should adapt this to evaluating power on time or MWH or similar with limited number of heats from an EAF.</p>
