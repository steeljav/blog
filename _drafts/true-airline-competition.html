<p>I have been a regular business traveler in the USA for the last 12 years. I drive as much as possible, but have to fly 90% of the time.</p>
<p>Flying in the USA sucks and is expensive. It has only gotten worse in the 12 years I can offer an opinion on.</p>
<p>With only 4 airlines and our system of hubs with dominant carriers there is no real competition. It seems like the airlines just follow each others pricing. Whichever is highest sets the bar. There are some exceptions depending on location, but few.</p>
<p>I went to the EU this summer and flew from Berlin to Paris, Paris to Krakow and Krakow to Frankfurt. Two of those on easyjet, one on Lufthansa. It was cheap, really cheap. So cheap that diving or taking the train was significantly more. Why is it so cheap to fly in the EU? There's real competition. There are multiple budget airlines: easyJet, Ryanair, eurowings, etc. Doubt this could ever happen in the USA because of the ability the dominant carriers have to keep others out of their hubs.</p>
