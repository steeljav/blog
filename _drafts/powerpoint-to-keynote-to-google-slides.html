<p>Had to give a presentation. No wifi which is normal at customer facilities. Was hoping powerpoint on iPhone could control powerpoint on mac, but no luck. Tried keynote but no luck without wifi. Imported large powerpoint presentation to keynote. Received notification of multiple fonts that were not present. Was amazed at the number of fonts in the powerpoint presentation. After remapping the fonts was amazed at how well the presentation imported to keynote. Have been wanting to switch my training material anyway, so this just made it that much easier.</p>
<p>Not sure what keynote live is, but think it would be useful since people can see it via the web.</p>
